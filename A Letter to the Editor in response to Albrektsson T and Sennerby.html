            <p>Subject: Article by Tomas Albrektsson and Lars Sennerby, Volume 3, 
              No. 1, Jan/Feb 1990: &quot;Direct Bone Anchorage of Oral Implants: Clinical 
              and Experimental Considerations of the Concept of Osseointegration.&quot; 
              The authors reach a number of conclusions in this article that are not 
              supported by the published articles they reference or a number of articles 
              they conveniently fail to reference. </p>
            <p>Osseointegration or Bone Loss as Criteria of Success. Albrektsson, 
              in an earlier article (JOMI, Vol. 1, No 1, 1986), stated what is clearly 
              the legacy of the Br&aring;nemark research: "The Br&aring;nemark results...clearly 
              underscore the basic concept of osseointegration as being the major, 
              if not the exclusive reason for a successful long-term dental implant 
              attachment." </p>
            <p>Albrektsson and Sennerby then attempt to negate the clinical significance 
              of this fact by applying a set of criteria proposed by Albrektsson, 
              Zarb, et al. (JOMI 1986;1:11-25) that included: &quot;That vertical 
              bone loss be less than 0.2 mm annually following the implant’s first 
              year of service.&quot;</p>
            <p>Based on this parameter, the authors conclude: "For osseointegrated 
              implants, it seems clear that the Br&aring;nemark fixtures meet the 
              success criteria...Core-Vent Implants do not meet these criteria for 
              success, and it is uncertain if the IMZ and the Calcitek hydroxyapatite-coated 
              implants will pass..."</p>
            <p>A review of the literature clearly demonstrates that the Br&aring;nemark 
              Implant success rates were based on fixture stability and fixture survival, 
              not bone loss. </p>
            <p>1. Adell: 17 Year Study on 4,100 Br&aring;nemark Implants (J Prosthet 
              Dent 1983;50(2):252): The anchorage function or the fixture survival 
              rate was defined as the number of stable, prosthesis supporting, osseointegrated 
              fixture in relation to the total number of fixtures installed.</p>
            <p>2. Br&aring;nemark, Zarb, Albrektsson (Eds.): Tissue-Integrated Prostheses 
              (Text, Quintessence Publ 1985): &quot;Fixture anchorage function&quot; 
              and &quot;fixture survival rate&quot; were the criteria for success." 
              Page 175: "The statistical basis for ascertaining the long-term prognosis 
              of a fixture-supported prosthesis depends on two factors: (1) continuous 
              bridge stability...(2) fixture anchorage function, which is the percentage 
              of clinically stable and/or radiographically osseointegrated fixtures."</p>
            <p>3. Engquist et al.: A Retrospective Multicenter Evaluation of Osseointegrated 
              Implant Supporting Overdentures. Eleven Swedish teams documented 30% 
              failure in Maxilla, 6% in Mandible (JOMI 1988;3(2)), Page 132: "An implant 
              was regarded successful if the fixture had been immobile throughout 
              the observation period and the radiographs showed no radiolucency around 
              the fixture at the final registration.&quot; Crestal bone loss was never 
              measured in this study: &quot;It was not possible to register marginal 
              bone loss with acceptable accuracy since the radiographic technique 
              was not standardized."</p>
            <p>Use of Bone Height Measurement as Criteria of Success. The invalidity 
              of the Albrektsson Zarb parameter (JOMI 1986, JPD 1989) as a measurement 
              of success becomes obvious when one considers its ramifications. For 
              example, if an 18 mm long implant lost 1 mm of bone from time of insertion 
              to one year following attachment of the prosthesis, and an additional 
              0.3 mm of bone during the implant’s second year in function, the implant 
              would have to be called a failure based on this criteria even though 
              it still had 16. 7 mm of its length osseointegrated. It would be ludicrous 
              to suggest that his implant, which was supporting the prosthesis without 
              pain or discomfort, be removed just because of applying Albrektsson 
              and Zarb’s proposed criteria of success. If, during each of the next 
              two years in service, the implant only lost 0.1 mm of bone height for 
              an average of 0.13 mm for the three years following the first year of 
              service, the implant that was a failure at two years would be a success 
              at four years, as judged by this criteria. Success rates would never 
              be able to be established using this criteria as they could fluctuate 
              from year to year.</p>
            <p>Albrektsson and Sennerby would have the profession believe that this 
              &quot;stricter criteria&quot; was used to judge success or failure with 
              Br&aring;nemark Implants so that other competitors of Nobelpharma would 
              have to meet this contrived test also. Multicenter studies of Albrektsson 
              et al. (J Prosthet Dent 1988;59:287-296) are referenced in this article 
              to support this misconception but, from review of these studies, it 
              is apparent that bone height measurements were not taken on every implant 
              and that fixture stability or osseointegration was the overriding parameter 
              in determining clinical success –– as it should be. </p>
            <p>Selective use of References. Albrektsson and Sennerby state: "To date, 
              the present authors are unaware of any scientifically controlled studies 
              supporting the verbal claims of excellent success rates of the Core-Vent 
              and IMZ, two frequently used osseointegrated oral implant systems." 
            </p>
            <p>They failed to reference an article by Kirsh and Ackerman (Dent Clin 
              North Am, October, 1989) on a 10- year follow-up of 2,284 titanium plasma-sprayed 
              IMZ implants, which Albrektsson was certainly aware of, as he had referenced 
              it in a previous article. Furthermore, in criticism of Core Vent implants, 
              the authors relied on an unpublished abstract of Moy with 100 Core-Vent 
              implants that demonstrated 84% to 87% success rates (Maxilla-Mandible). 
              But then, by using his own subjective criteria, Moy had predicted the 
              final success rates would only be 58% to 68%. Albrektsson and Sennerby 
              referenced Moy’s projected failure rates, which have never been confirmed 
              in a subsequent abstract or published article, and incorrectly referred 
              to these unsubstantiated, projected rates as &quot;actual success rate.&quot; 
              Albrektsson and Sennerby, while referencing the unpublished abstract 
              of Moy from a 1987 meeting, failed to mention three other unpublished 
              abstracts presented at the same meeting: Lubar with 100 consecutively 
              placed Core Vent Implants, all over 4 years, reported 95% success, Zosky 
              with 200 Core-Vent’s reported 93% success (96% in the Maxilla alone), 
              and English, who conducted a survey of 672 Core-Vent users, reported 
              on 15,150 implants with 93% success.</p>
            <p>Malmqvist and Sennerby Study of 47 Core-Vent (43 followed for 3 to 
              48 months). Albrektsson and Sennerby also reference an article which 
              Sennerby was a co-author. This study reports 33 mandibular implant(s) 
              with 29 surviving, stable in function for 88% success rate (as best 
              as can be determined from the published article) but then, by claiming 
              to apply Albrektsson’s bone loss criteria, judged these same Core-Vent 
              Implants to be only 15.6% successful. This was despite obvious deficiencies 
              in the study. Malmqvist and Sennerby admitted in their article that: 
              &quot;panoramic and sometimes periapical radiographs were available...the 
              vertical bone loss occurring during the period from surgery to prostheses 
              connection could not be measured.&quot;</p>
            <p>Albrektsson, in a lecture at the 1989 American Academy of Periodontics 
              Annual Meeting, confirmed his awareness that panoramic radiographs are 
              inadequate to measure bone loss: &quot;You have to have individual radiographs. 
              I think that bone loss you calculate in orthopantograms doesn’t give 
              you much information.&quot; Malmqvist and Sennerby admit that because 
              of inadequate radiographic documentation, they were unable to segregate 
              initial bone loss due to surgical trauma or selection of too wide an 
              implant from the type of annual bone loss the Albrektsson criteria sought 
              to evaluate, so they arbitrarily allowed 2 mm in their calculations. 
              Improper selection by the surgeon of too wide a Core-Vent Implant, which 
              is available in 3 diameters, could cause more than 2 mm of bone loss 
              at insertion.</p>
            <p>Failure to Reference Patrick et al. Study of 1,605 Core-Vents. The 
              Patrick et al. 5-year published study, which clearly states that it 
              used osseointegration as the criteria of success, documented 1,605 consecutively 
              placed Core-Vent Implants with an overall success of 96% (Oral Implantol, 
              Vol. XV, No. 2, 1989). As part of the Patrick et al. study, only 7 out 
              of 342 or 2% of the Core-Vent Implants in the partially edentulous maxilla 
              failed for a 98% success (same for anterior and posterior arches). This 
              included 45 freestanding, single tooth replacements, all of which achieved 
              and maintained osseointegration. When this is compared to 7 failed Core-Vents 
              out of only 10 placed in the maxillary partially edentulous jaws by 
              Malmqvist, it is ludicrous for the Malmqvist-Sennerby article to blame 
              the Core-Vent Implant’s design or surgical protocol without even considering 
              operator error in surgical protocol or implant diameter selection for 
              the available bone width. Since both Albrektsson and Sennerby had previously 
              referenced the Patrick et al. study when it was only an abstract, there 
              is no excuse for not referencing it now that it has been published in 
              a refereed journal.</p>
            <p>Albrektsson and Sennerby Perpetuate the Myth of Pure Titanium. Professor 
              Frank Young, Editor of the Journal of Biomaterials, in a presentation 
              before the 1988 NIH Consensus Conference, stated: "Commercially pure 
              titanium has barely adequate mechanical properties (low hardness and 
              tensile strength) for dental implant applications and, although it is 
              a logical starting material, unalloyed metals usually are not found 
              to be optimum...the clinical success of the titanium alloys under relatively 
              crude conditions is remarkable."</p>
            <p>Albrektsson and Sennerby claim that &quot;Commercially pure titanium 
              screws show a significantly higher proportion of mature bone in contact 
              with the material than similar Ti-6Al-4V screws.&quot; The authors, 
              in reaching this conclusion, rely on a study by their co-workers, Johansson 
              et al. (J Biomed Eng 1989;11:3-8) that compared only five screws of 
              alloy and five of pure titanium in the tibia of rabbits at the light 
              microscope and SEM level. Albrektsson and Sennerby, while referencing 
              an article by other Swedish researchers, Linder et al. (Acta Orthop 
              Scand 1989;60:129-134) that refuted Johansson’s conclusions, attempt 
              to negate the significance of the Linder article by stating that &quot;if 
              a quantified approach is used, there are clear differences in tissue 
              reactions to such widely different materials.&quot; In fact, the Linder 
              histological study, also in the tibia of rabbits, states that the sections 
              &quot;were also analyzed morphometrically using a Merz grid to estimate 
              the amount of periosteal and endosteal new bone formation.&quot; In 
              evaluating 76 implants including 38 pure titanium and 10 titanium alloy 
              implants, only 3 implants failed to osseointegrate –– 2 were pure titanium 
              and 1 was stainless steel. The authors concluded that, &quot;with the 
              exception of these 3 cases, the bony reaction was remarkably consistent; 
              and of the recorded histologic parameters, only three showed variations.&quot;</p>
            <p>Albrektsson and Sennerby further reference an unpublished study, co-authored 
              by Albrektsson, which used a torque test to remove various screws. They 
              conclude that &quot;the torque necessary to remove CP titanium implants 
              was also significantly higher than the corresponding removal torque 
              of the titanium alloy implants.&quot; The logical explanation for this 
              is that pure titanium, being a softer material than titanium alloy, 
              machines to a rougher surface than the alloy, thus providing more mechanical 
              resistance to unscrewing.</p>
            <p>Conclusion. Albrektsson and Sennerby must be held accountable for misstatements 
              and disinformation made in their articles. </p>
