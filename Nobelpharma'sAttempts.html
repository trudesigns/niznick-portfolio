            </b> 
            <p>In response to Nobelpharma’s &quot;Open Letter&quot; to all Oral Surgeons 
              and Prosthodontists, it is Core Vent Corporation’s position that the 
              published results of the Br&aring;nemark research are now the property 
              of the dental profession and are subject to interpretation and reference 
              EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OF THOSE 
              NOW PROMOTING THE SALE of the implant used in this research project.</p>
            <p>I agree completely with the statement contained in Nobelpharma’s letter 
              that &quot;FACTS, NOT PROMISES, SHOULD BE THE BASIS OF COMPARISON IN 
              MATTERS OF ORAL HEALTH.&quot;</p>
            <p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS DETAILED REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE AND COMPARATIVE 
              ANALYSIS IS TO ESTABLISH THE FOLLOWING FACTS:</p>
            <p>1. The Br&aring;nemark research proved the long-term predictability 
              of an implant that can achieve direct bone anchorage, termed &quot;osseointegration.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>2. The Br&aring;nemark research was not the first to report on a direct 
              bone anchorage to titanium. </p>
            <p>3. The Br&aring;nemark research was not the first to use a submergible 
              screw implant with internal threading for attachment of the prosthesis.</p>
            <p>4. The Br&aring;nemark research did not prove that pure titanium had 
              any advantages over titanium alloy in achieving and maintaining osseointegration.</p>
            <p>5. The Br&aring;nemark research did not prove that the surface finish 
              and geometry of their implant was the only one, or even the best one, 
              for achieving and maintaining osseointegration.</p>
            <p>6. The Br&aring;nemark method, according to the Swedish National Board 
              of Health:</p>
            <p>&#9;&quot;...seemed not to satisfy certain clinical objective requirements 
              regarding prosthetic treatment.&quot;</p>
            <p>&#9;&quot;...should be limited to teaching institutions or hospitals 
              with special resources.&quot; </p>
            <p>7. The real legacy of the Br&aring;nemark research is that, for any 
              endosseous implant that can achieve osseointegration, &quot;a reliable 
              prognosis can be made in the individual case after the first year.&quot; 
              This is &quot;the test of time&quot; that is relevant in evaluating 
              any osseointegrated implant (quotes from Nobelpharma’s &quot;Open Letter&quot; 
              and the Br&aring;nemark conclusions that accompanied the letter).</p>
            <p>8. The Core-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> Implant System provides the features 
              inherent in the Br&aring;nemark method that account for its success 
              while additionally offering simplified surgical procedures and versatile 
              prosthetic applications at a cost that makes &quot;osseointegration 
              in clinical dentistry&quot; a reality. </p>
            <p>REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE</p>
            <p>The 20 years of clinical research conducted under the direction of 
              Dr. Br&aring;nemark [1] at Gothenburg, Sweden undoubtedly has changed 
              the way the dental profession perceives long-term predictability with 
              endosseous implants. Dr. Br&aring;nemark and his co-workers have provided 
              a skeptical academic community with a long-term, prospective clinical 
              study that withstands scientific and statistical scrutiny. Published 
              research has always served as the basis for subsequent technological 
              advances –– contributions of those who preceeded are recognized by the 
              way of reference. It is important to understand the evolution of the 
              osseointegrated implant in order to insure the future of Implant Prosthodontics 
              in clinical dentistry.</p>
            <p>In 1951, Leventhal [2], in experimental studies, observed that bone 
              appeared to become anchored to titanium. In France, Chercheve, in 1958 
              [3], was the first to use a submergible hollow screw implant fitted 
              into a previously bored hole created by surgical tap of the same diameter. 
              Benaim in 1959 [4] published his development of a solid, submergible, 
              stainless steel screw with a vent for bone growth and with internal 
              threading in its superior aspect for attachment of the prosthesis. Br&aring;nemark 
              [1] started his clinical research 6 years later (1965) using a similarly 
              designed submergible screw made from titanium instead of stainless steel 
              to test his theory that if direct bone attachment could be achieved 
              (versus a connective tissue interface), long-term predictability would 
              be a reality. Linkow [5] described a three-dimensional hollow-basket 
              implant in 1965. It was of one-piece design with a solid post extending 
              immediately through the oral mucosa. Straumann and Sutter [6] refined 
              the design and insertion technique of the hollow-basket implant by incorporating 
              an internally threaded screw in the post and by systematizing the instrumentation 
              using trephine drills that left a bone core at the base of the receptor 
              site. </p>
            <p>The Core-Vent Implant [7, 8] combined the hollow-basket design with 
              self-tapping threads to make a screw implant that had increased load 
              distribution capabilities. By maintaining a constant major diameter 
              throughout the entire length, the cylindrical design further increased 
              the surface area while making it possible to shorten each Core-Vent 
              Implant to 8 different lengths. Preparation of the 8 corresponding receptor 
              sites is accomplished with one internally irrigated trephine instrument 
              marked with gage lines for depth control. A two-stage bone preparation 
              procedure was developed to facilitate this: Stage I creates a bone core 
              that is then removed by fracturing to create a chamber for the threaded 
              neck portion of the Core-Vent Implant. Stage II creates a bone core 
              that is left intact. On insertion of the self-tapping screw implant, 
              this bone core becomes encompassed by the hollow-basket lower portion, 
              thus minimizing the amount of bone that requires regeneration in order 
              for the jaw to totally incorporate the Core-Vent Implant. The modifiability 
              of the length enhances load distribution by facilitating maximum use 
              of available bone. </p>
            <p>In addition, the Core-Vent Implant was designed to be submergible to 
              avoid premature loading –– a hexagonal hole extending down from the 
              superior aspect of the implant facilitates ratcheting of the self-tapping 
              implant to place and then accepts a plastic rod for easy uncovering 
              following the initial submerged healing period. A variety of bendable 
              abutment heads were designed to be cemented into the hexagonal hole 
              so that the Core-Vent Implant can be used not only for detachable fixed 
              prosthesis as used in the Br&aring;nemark research, but also free-standing 
              single tooth replacements, abutments for fixed bridges and free-standing 
              in the symphysis to retain overdentures –– three applications not available 
              with the Br&aring;nemark System. Advances in the last 20 years in biomaterials 
              (new titanium alloys and plastics), biomechanics (photoelastic and finite 
              element studies), and computer controlled machining now make possible 
              more sophisticated implant designs and insertion techniques. For osseointegration 
              to have relevance to clinical dentistry in this country, the method 
              of connecting and supporting fixed prostheses and overdenture superstructures 
              to the Br&aring;nemark implant would necessitate redesigning of the 
              implant itself to allow for attachment of bendable heads. </p>
            <p>PURE TITANIUM VERSUS TITANIUM ALLOY</p>
            <p>The Core-Vent Implant is made from FDA-approved titanium alloy (Ti 
              6Al/4V), which is 60% stronger than pure titanium and with better machining 
              properties to allow the production of even small diameters of the delicate 
              hollow-vented design. Both pure titanium and properly prepared Ti 6Al/4V 
              ELI (low interstitial oxygen) titanium alloy have the same titanium 
              oxide on the surface since the aluminum and the vanadium are not self-passivating 
              and, therefore, do not readily oxidize. As Zarb [9] stated in regard 
              to Kasemo’s article [10], &quot;Because the surface exposed to the biologic 
              host system consists of a metal oxide, not a metal, it is the oxide 
              that governs the chemistry at the implant-biotissue interface.&quot; 
              Br&aring;nemark [1] discussed the research results of Morse [11], who 
              had used titanium alloy in dental implants and reported on two specimens 
              removed after approximately 2 years. Br&aring;nemark stated (Review 
              of the Literature –– Interface, page 11): "The main corrosion product 
              (on the surface) was titanium oxide, believed to be relatively inert. 
              The used implants showed closely adherent opaque protuberances at various 
              points on the surface and electron probe analysis revealed the presence 
              of calcium and phosphorous, which was compatible with a designation 
              of bony attachment."</p>
            <p>THE BR&Aring;NEMARK RESEARCH</p>
            <p>As with all research, Br&aring;nemark started out with a hypothesis 
              –– that direct bone anchorage (later termed osseointegration) would 
              provide long-term predictability. Because of Sweden’s socialized health 
              care and its non-migratory population, he was able to do what no implant 
              researcher had done previously or since. He was able to carry out a 
              prospective, clinical study for over 15 years and proved his theory 
              of the long-term predictability of osseointegration. To obtain valid 
              statistics, he maintained certain controls over the period of this study. 
              For instance, the following factors remained constant: location of the 
              implants in the symphysis and anterior maxilla of totally edentulous 
              jaws, the design of the superstructure, the material and design of the 
              submergible screw implant. Br&aring;nemark did not use several different 
              designs, surfaces or materials as controls to evaluate which was the 
              best since he was testing his theory of osseointegration –– not testing 
              various designs, surfaces or materials. Br&aring;nemark [1] has stated 
              in his report of the first 10 years results with reference to implant 
              design and material: "The design of the implant, which has attracted 
              a dominating interest in the literature, is of secondary importance 
              to the mechanism of anchorage in the jaw bone...The careful handling 
              of the tissue and the use of an inert, non-contaminated material are 
              the prime prerequisites for osseointegration."</p>
            <p>COMPARE BR&Aring;NEMARK’S 10-YEAR REPORT [1] WITH NOBELPHARMA’S INTERPRETATION</p>
            <p>--- WHAT IS OSSEOINTEGRATION?</p>
            <p>--- HOW IS OSSEOINTEGRATION ACHIEVED?</p>
            <p>Accompanying the letter from the President of Nobelpharma was a list 
              of 10 points entitled, &quot;Summary and Conclusions&quot; of the 15-year 
              Study of Osseointegration Implants.</p>
            <p>I disagree with only the 1st point listed.</p>
            <p>&#9;Point #1: &quot;Osseointegration implies a direct and intimate 
              incorporation in vital bone of threaded fixtures of defined finish and 
              geometry.&quot;</p>
            <p>There is no need to speculate what &quot;osseointegration implies&quot; 
              or what factors are essential for its achievement. Br&aring;nemark [12] 
              defined osseointegration in his article in the August 1984 AAOMS Journal 
              –– &quot;Osseointegration means a direct contact, on the light-microscopic 
              level, between living bone tissue and the implant.&quot;</p>
            <p>CORE-VENT IMPLANTS HAVE MET THIS CRITERIA in both animal studies and 
              human specimens.</p>
            <p>Nowhere in the 9 points listed on pages #122-#125 of the &quot;Conclusions 
              and Summary&quot; of the 10 year report [1] is there any mention of 
              the design, surface finish or even the material of the implant and no 
              mention that the research intended on evaluating anything other than 
              the anchorage mechanism. Point #1 of the conclusions of the 10-year 
              results even scoffs at the preoccupation of the other researchers who 
              have concentrated their concerns on the designs and material of the 
              endosseous component.</p>
            <p>Conclusion #1 stated: </p>
            <p>&#9;To date, there remains more interest in developing new materials 
              and designs than in evaluating tissue responses and inquiring into how 
              a tissue can be made to accept an implant. We have demonstrated that 
              it is possible to achieve true osseointegration with careful surgical 
              handling of bone tissue at preparation and close monitoring of healing 
              time and load on the implant.</p>
            <p>The 2nd Point of the list of summary and conclusions that accompanied 
              Nobelpharma’s open letter states exactly how osseointegration is achieved.</p>
            <p>&#9;Point #2: &quot;Osseointegration can be achieved if the fixtures 
              (implants) are inserted with delicate surgical technique and allowed 
              to heal, without load, for periods of not less than 3-4 months in lower 
              jaw, and 5-6 months in upper jaw.&quot;</p>
            <p>In the Readers’ Round Table section of the July issue of the Journal 
              of Prosthetic Dentistry [13], I stated:</p>
            <p>&#9;The Br&aring;nemark research did not compare various surfaces by 
              using controlled research techniques. Likewise, the Br&aring;nemark 
              research did not prove that the design of their fixture was the optimum 
              one or one that could withstand functional forces without multiple splinting. 
              The preparation technique for the Br&aring;nemark implant as outlined 
              in the article by Kasemo [10] is standard practice for machining metal.</p>
            <p>Dr. Zarb, a leading advocate of, and spokesman for the Br&aring;nemark 
              System, was invited by the Editor to respond to my letter in the Journal 
              of Prosthetic Dentistry –– HE DECLINED.</p>
            <p>Enclosed you will find a copy of this letter to the editor. On the 
              reverse side, I have listed the essential requirements to achieve and 
              maintain osseointegration as proven by the Br&aring;nemark research 
              and correspondingly, how THE CORE-VENT IMPLANT SYSTEM FULFILLS THESE 
              REQUIREMENTS. </p>
            <p>OSSEOINTEGRATION STANDS THE TEST OF TIME</p>
            <p>The president of Nobelpharma stated in his letter, &quot;We are aware 
              that other companies have been utilizing Professor Br&aring;nemark’s 
              work to foster interest in products that have not stood the test of 
              time.&quot; The 7th point of their Summary and Conclusions specifically 
              states what is the required &quot;test of time&quot;:</p>
            <p>&#9;Point #7: &quot;A reliable prognosis can be made in the individual 
              case after the first year.&quot;</p>
            <p>The physiological explanation why this is true is also found in Point 
              #1 of the Conclusions of the 10-year results [1]: &quot;Roentgenologic 
              and histologic studies clearly show that the anchoring bone is vital 
              and remodels to fit the dynamics of the load.&quot; If the bone accepts 
              the load placed on the osseointegrated implant and remodels according 
              to function, there is no physiological reason why the implant should 
              not remain in a &quot;steady state&quot; indefinitely if the prosthesis 
              allows the patient to maintain proper oral hygiene. The Core-Vent Implant 
              maximizes the surface area by using a hollow-vented design and taking 
              advantage of the three diameters, each modifiable to eight lengths. 
              The stress at the interface is reduced to the point that osseointegration 
              can be maintained during the critical initial loading period –– even 
              when the implant is used as a free-standing replacement. </p>
            <p>Statistical analysis by Hansson [14] indicated that implants remaining 
              osseointegrated in function for 11 months have a lifetime predictability 
              of 98% in the lower jaw and 94% in the upper jaw.</p>
            <p>THIS FINDING IS THE REAL LEGACY OF THE BR&Aring;NEMARK RESEARCH. To 
              try to interpret the results in terms of the design and material of 
              the implant itself –– by Nobelpharma and others personally committed 
              to propagating the Br&aring;nemark System –– defeats the purpose and 
              universal application of Br&aring;nemark’s research.</p>
            <p>THE NOBELPHARMA LETTER STATES:</p>
            <p>&quot;Remember, THERE IS ONLY ONE BR&Aring;NEMARK METHOD –– make no 
              mistake!&quot; </p>
            <p>This is the same system that their own Swedish National Board of Health 
              and Welfare reported [15] on 17 randomly selected cases in the Journal 
              of Prosthetic Dentistry and found as follows:</p>
            <p>&#9;Nine of seventeen patients showed a satisfactory occlusion while 
              eight were unstable occlusally.</p>
            <p>&#9;Interproximal spaces were not accessible for hygiene purposes in 
              11 patients.</p>
            <p>&#9;The osseointegration method seemed... not to satisfy certain clinical 
              objective requirements regarding prosthesis treatment.</p>
            <p>&#9;The evaluating group stated that this method should be used only 
              by a team of specialists, not by the general practicing dentists. This 
              means that treatment of this kind should be limited to teaching institutions 
              or hospitals with special resources.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>IMPLANT PROSTHODONTICS</p>
            <p>Dentists around the world are achieving osseointegration on a highly 
              consistent basis with Core Vent Implants. Since the Core-Vent Implant 
              became commercially available almost 3 years ago, no one has reported 
              the loss of any Core-Vent Implants once osseointegration was achieved 
              and the implant was placed in function supporting or retaining a prosthesis. 
              Considering that many of the Core-Vent Implants have been used free-standing 
              to retain overdentures, osseointegration of the hollow-vented Core-Vent 
              design can withstand forces even greater than those contemplated by 
              Br&aring;nemark. The Core-Vent Implant System is now in use in more 
              than 30 universities and teaching institutions in this country with 
              several (e.g. Harvard University, Medical College of Georgia, University 
              of Florida) using both the Br&aring;nemark and Core-Vent Systems.</p>
            <p>As a prosthodontist, I designed the Core-Vent Implant System to implement 
              my philosophy of Implant Prosthodontics –– maximize the benefits while 
              minimizing the risk and expense to the patient. The Core-Vent Implant 
              System can be used to restore the totally edentulous jaw with fixed/detachable 
              splinting similar to the Swedish system but, since the necks of the 
              heads are bendable and contoured, the construction of the fixed prosthesis 
              can be carried out to the high standards of esthetics, phonetics, oral 
              hygiene and occlusion that the American public has come to expect. The 
              Core-Vent Implant was designed to be inserted with a minimum of instruments 
              and each implant can be modified to 8 lengths. These cost-effective 
              design features mean that the advantages of a predictable osseointegrated 
              implant system providing proper prosthetics can now be translated to 
              the benefit of a large number of patients for a fee well within the 
              range of conventional restorative and prosthetic dentistry.</p>
            <p>IS NOT THIS THE PURPOSE OF ALL CLINICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT?</p>
