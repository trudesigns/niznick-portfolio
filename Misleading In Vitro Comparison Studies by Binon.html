              of current interest to the speciality of prosthodontics. Letters should

            <p>The following letter was received in response to &quot;Binon, Paul 
              P. Evaluation of Machining Accuracy and Consistency of Selected Implants, 
              Standard Abutments, and Laboratory Analogs. Int J Prosthodont 1995;8(2):162-178.&quot;</p>
            <p>Dr. Binon’s article incorrectly states that he measured selected features 
              on &quot;randomly selected implants&quot; in arriving at a "composite" 
              number for purposes of comparison of machining accuracy when in fact 
              he solicited components from various companies, rather than buying the 
              products in the open market. This incorporates a lack of control in 
              his study that negates the validity of any observations and conclusions. 
              Such a method of sample acquisition can easily bias the results by one 
              or more companies submitting consecutively made implants for testing 
              while the other companies submit implants from inventory. </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>Dr. Binon reported that one implant company [Implant Innovations&reg;/3i&reg;] 
              demonstrated a range of measurements across the flats of the hexes of 
              only 1 micron, which equals +/- 0.00002&quot;. This represents 5 times 
              the accuracy that the CNC machines used in manufacturing implants within 
              the industry are capable of maintaining other than between consecutively 
              made implants. </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>The parameters that Dr. Binon chose to measure in determining his composite 
              value for comparison have no significance in determining interfacial 
              gap or rotational stability, the clinically relevant parameters of a 
              precision fit. </p>
            <p>The most egregious error in Dr. Binon’s article is his misrepresentation 
              of the pictured gap between the Screw-Vent implant and abutment in Figs. 
              13a to 13d. Dr. Binon measured 10 Screw Vent implant/abutment combinations 
              and reported in his study that they demonstrated an average of 45 microns 
              of interfacial gap at the surface. Using the micron scale on the SEM, 
              one can easily determine that the gap on Fig. 13b is approximately 200µ, 
              thus bringing in question Dr. Binon’s measuring accuracy. The section 
              of the abutment shown in Figs. 13a to 13d indicates that Dr. Binon failed 
              to fully seat the abutment before making interfacial measurements. Dr. 
              Binon incorrectly attributed this failure to seat the abutment to what 
              he perceived as metal fragments in the internal hex of the implant from 
              manufacturing. In fact, this internal debris was nothing more than an 
              artifact caused by sectioning of the implant/abutment combination.</p>
            <p>&#9;&#9;</p>
            <p>At my request, Dr. Binon submitted the sectioned specimen along with 
              two other Screw-Vent implant/abutment combinations to an independent 
              analytic laboratory of his choice. The laboratory report, provided to 
              me by Dr. Binon, confirms that the metallurgist &quot;did not see the 
              metal interference in the implant hexagonal recess to be anything more 
              than a burr from preparation which was in several locations and was 
              easily removed.&quot; The laboratory report conducted at Dr. Binon’s 
              request and expense, concluded, after sectioning and evaluating two 
              other Screw-Vent assemblies that had been used in Dr. Binon’s, study 
              that: &quot;The abutment/implant interface is excellent for the device 
              on page G4 (of the report). The gap is very small for the device shown 
              on G5.&quot;</p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>The positive aspect of Dr. Binon’s study is that it points out the 
              importance of rotational stability between abutment and implant. Although 
              he measures variations in width of opposing flats of external hexes 
              of the implants as part of his &quot;composite&quot; number for comparison 
              purposes, these measurements show no correlation to actual rotational 
              stability measurements that he reports on. This relationship can only 
              be measured directly, as Dr. Binon also did, by determining the rotation 
              in degrees between the implant and the abutment. Dr. Binon first presented 
              the rotational stability data reported in this article at the Academy 
              of Osseointegration meeting in March of 1993 and it reflects products 
              produced in 1992. Then, as now, Dr. Binon reported that the Screw-Vent 
              internal hex connection demonstrated 1.4 degrees of rotation compared 
              to a range of 3.5 to 10.1 degrees for external hex implants and 7.5 
              degrees for internal octagon implants.</p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>To entirely eliminate rotational wobble between mating hexes (internal 
              or external hex implants), a new concept of screw-retained abutments 
              was needed --- controlled intentional interference to create a friction 
              fitting of the interdigitating hexes. This was first accomplished in 
              1993 by tapering the male hex of the Spectra-System abutments by one 
              degree and in 1994 by tapering the external hex of the Swede-Vent TL 
              (Taper-Lock) implant by 1.5 degree (Figure #1, herein). By creating 
              a friction fit, lateral forces are transferred directly to the hex of 
              the implant from the mating hex of the abutment, almost completely eliminating 
              cyclic loading stresses on the abutment screw during function [G. A. 
              Niznick Patents: Implant Internal Hex (Pat. No. 4,431,416), Abutment 
              Tapered Hex (Pat. No. 5,334,024), Implant Tapered External Hex (Pat. 
              No. 5,433,606)]</p>
            <p>In conclusion, I encourage Dr. Binon and others to continue research 
              on the quality, precision, strength and stability of dental implant 
              components, focusing on clinically significant parameters and using 
              accepted, controlled scientific methods. </p>

            <p>The Author’s Reply</p>
            <p>In response to Dr. Niznick’s letter, the following points need clarification 
              and correction:</p>
            <p>1. It is necessary to correct an erroneous conclusion regarding the 
              SEM illustrations of the Screw Vent implant. Figure 13C illustrates 
              what I believe to be a metal bur extending from the implant lateral 
              wall that prevented full seating of the abutment. Remounting and repolishing 
              of the specimen has confirmed that this projection is an artifact resulting 
              from the sectioning technique employed. It is unfortunate that although 
              Dr. Niznick reviewed this SEM slide on two occasions, the bur/artifact 
              issue was not raised until after the photographs were published. Once 
              the issue was raised, an independent laboratory evaluation was initiated 
              and the error was identified. I apologize to Core-Vent Bio-Engineering 
              and the Dentsply Implant Division for the incorrect interpretation and 
              any negative reflection this may have caused on their product.</p>
            <p> &#9;</p>
            <p>2. Most of the samples, including the Core-Vent samples, were obtained 
              directly from the manufacturer. To be used in the study, it was requested 
              that the components be pulled from available inventory, in ready-to-ship 
              sealed packaging with batch numbers intact. Dr. Niznick raised the issue 
              of company tampering and/or culling components, in order to bias results, 
              in June of 1993. Subsequently, I measured external hexagonal extensions 
              on three additional groups of implants from 3i, NP, and ISS that were 
              being used for a totally unrelated study on conical abutments. These 
              implants were obtained from the manufacturer, from my office stock, 
              and/or traded. The results indicated that the data sets were consistent.</p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>3. The interface gap illustrated in Figure 13B is not representative 
              of the 30 to 70 micron gap reported in the article.</p>
            <p> &#9;</p>
            <p>4. The implant/abutment stack was seated and tightened to the full 
              extent possible with the stainless ratchet driver supplied by Dr. Niznick 
              along with the implant components. Other factors may have been responsible 
              for the interface defect, however, inadequate tightening was definitely 
              not.</p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>Ongoing research has identified rotational instability (rotational 
              misfit) as a major causative factor in screw loosening. I am convinced 
              that the Screw-Vent internal hexagonal design, when fully seated, offers 
              one of the best solutions to improved abutment stability, antirotation 
              and screw loosening available today. The evolution and refinement of 
              the Core-Vent friction fit external and internal hexagonals is being 
              evaluated further and will be reported on in the near future.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Paul P. Binon, DDS, MSD</p>
            <p>Department of Restorative Dentistry</p>
            <p>School of Dentistry</p>
            <p>University of California, SF</p>
            <p>San Francisco, California</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Dr. Niznick’s Response</p>
            <p>1. Contrary to Dr. Binon’s claim, I did point out to him on two occasions 
              following his presentations that what he was interpreting as a bur on 
              the SEM would not interfere with full seating of the implant, and was 
              most likely a sectioning artifact. Anyone who knows me would know that 
              I would not let a misrepresentation of Core-Vent products go unanswered. 
            </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>2. While Dr. Binon may have requested that the samples tested be provided 
              by the manufacturers and &quot;pulled from available inventory,&quot; 
              he has no way of knowing if, in fact, this was done. If a second batch 
              of implants provided data that was consistent with the first batch, 
              and both batches yielded measurements that were beyond the tolerance 
              capabilities of the CNC machines used to manufacture dental implants, 
              it merely confirms that both batches from a particular manufacturer 
              [3i] were culled to show an exaggerated precision of that company’s 
              products. </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>3. I realize that the SEM in question was not used to measure the interface 
              gap reported in the article. It would take SEMs to measure the 1 micron 
              of accuracy that Dr. Binon claims to have measured on one of the company’s 
              samples he reported on. </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>4. Dr. Binon clearly does not understand the design or function of 
              Core-Vent’s internal hex, friction-fit connection if he can state that 
              the SEM does show &quot;excellent wall contact indicative of proper 
              seating.&quot; The male hex of the abutment is tapered 1.5 degrees, 
              and is designed to interfere fit half way down the 1.5mm length of the 
              internal hex. Only by applying 2 to 3 inch-pounds of torque will the 
              part fully seat in order for the mating bevels of the components to 
              come into contact, as demonstrated in the SEM picture published with 
              my Letter to the Editor. Since Dr. Binon has acknowledged not using 
              a torque wrench to seat the abutment, he cannot assert that &quot;inadequate 
              tightening was definitely not&quot; the cause of failure to seat the 
              abutment. I don’t contend that the abutment was &quot;improperly seated,&quot; 
              only that it was not &quot;fully seated.&quot; Regardless of whether 
              inadequate tightening, cross-threading or some other error caused failure 
              to fully seat the abutment, the misrepresentation in Dr. Binon’s article 
              was that his SEM represented full seating, which he now admits was inaccurate. 
            </p>
            <p>&#9;</p>
            <p>It is unfortunate that Dr. Binon’s response to my Letter is more concerned 
              with face-saving at the expense of further misrepresentations about 
              Core-Vent’s products, than with just correcting the admitted errors 
              of his article.</p>
