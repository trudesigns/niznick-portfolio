            <p align="CENTER">LETTER TO THE EDITOR</p>
            <p align="CENTER">International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants 
              1995, Vol. 10, No. 1, Pages 1-2</p>
            <p>TO THE EDITOR:</p>
            <p>The &quot;Special Supplement&quot; Issue, Volume 9, 1994 of the Journal 
              represents the transcribed proceedings of a 1992 conference limited 
              to approximately 100 invited clinicians and scientists. Because the 
              conference organizers restricted participation, I disagree with Dr. 
              Laney's introductory remarks in the Journal that the "experience-based 
              positions" of the participants &quot;may be considered the state of 
              osseointegration in private practice at this chronological stage of 
              clinical application.&quot; Publications such as this "Special Supplement" 
              of the JOMI unfortunately perpetuate the myth that if solutions to clinical 
              problems are not provided by the three foreign implant systems, they 
              must not be worthy of consideration.</p>
            <p>Implant/Abutment Stability</p>
            <p>In Topic 1, one dentist, who relies primarily on the Br&aring;nemark 
              system, identified &quot;loose screws&quot; on thread-retained abutments 
              as today’s "number one restorative problem with retrievable systems." 
              Another dentist identified "rotational stability" as "still a big problem" 
              with external-hex screw implants and also expressed his concerns regarding 
              &quot;damage to the fixture hex" and fracture of the fixture itself 
              with single-tooth applications. He concludes that &quot;the limitations 
              of standard implants are now known," but continues to use Br&aring;nemark 
              implants and 3i clones. Solutions to unstable implant/abutment connection 
              and to fractured screw implants inherent with standard external hex 
              implants made from commercially pure titanium have been available since 
              1990 with titanium or titanium alloy implants with the internal Hex-Thread 
              Connection (Core-Vent US Patent #4,960,381). Discussions in Topic 5 
              emphasize the importance of a precision fit between implant and abutment 
              in reducing center-screw loosening. To support claims of superior precision, 
              Keith Beaty, President of 3i, included a chart (Fig. 5-4) of the diameters 
              of external hexes on implants from six companies. This data, supposedly 
              presented in 1992, was from a study not published until 1994 (Schulte, 
              J Impl Dent 1994;3(1)). Such studies are easily biased by one company 
              submitting consecutively manufactured implants while the other companies 
              submit implants from inventory. I confirmed that the graph was misleading 
              by measuring the hex diameter of five 3i implants of different lengths 
              to assure that they were not consecutively made. Their tolerance range 
              was no better than the average of four of the five competitors cited 
              in the chart, excluding Nobelpharma, which had the highest variation 
              in measurements. </p>
            <p>The real issue of precision is how well a company's abutment fits on 
              its own implants. Dr. Binon reported on such measurements at the 1993 
              AO Meeting. Screw-Vent’s internal hex connection demonstrated only 1.4 
              degrees of rotational instability compared to 4.6 degrees for 3i and 
              6.7 degrees for Nobelpharma components. The internal hex connection 
              (1.5mm deep) provides 2-3 times the length of interdigitation of commercially 
              available external hex implants, which could account for its superior 
              stability. To entirely eliminate rotational wobble, a new concept of 
              screw-retained abutments is needed –– intentional interference or friction 
              fitting of the interdigitating hexes. This was first accomplished in 
              1992 by tapering the male hex on abutments by one degree (Core-Vent 
              US Patent 5,334,024). This combines the frictional retention, requiring 
              10-20 Ncm force during tightening of the fixation screw to fully seat 
              the abutment, with the anti rotational benefits of interdigitating hexes. 
              The result is that 25 pounds of frictional retention is created between 
              the abutment with zero rotational "hex play" and with approximately 
              4 times the compressive strength at 30 degrees than Nobelpharma's implant 
              and abutment assembly can withstand. This friction fit concept has now 
              been adapted to a new Swede-Vent TL Taper-Lock Implant by creating a 
              tapered external hex on the implant (Core-Vent Patent Pending). The 
              result is complete elimination of &quot;hex play&quot; with an external 
              hex implant which Binon in Topic 5 cites as one of the main causes of 
              screw loosening, the complication listed in Topic 1 as today’s "number 
              one restorative problem with retrievable systems." </p>
            <p>HA Surface Criticism</p>
            <p>To perpetuate the mind-set that the foreign implant systems offer the 
              only credible implant alternatives, seven of the nine panel members 
              assigned to Topics 2 and 3, which dealt with the use of "different implant 
              designs" and "different implant surfaces" represent these systems. Of 
              the remaining two panel members, one had published a controversial article 
              highly critical of HA coated cylinder implants. With these two panels 
              so constituted, their conclusion supportive of a machined or TPS-coated 
              implant surface and critical of HA coatings was highly predictable. 
              What was overlooked by the panels in attributing responsibility to the 
              HA coating for bone cratering at the crest around HA-coated cylinder 
              implants, is that cylinders do not distribute vertical and lateral forces 
              to the jawbone as well as screw implants (French et al., Int J Periodont 
              Rest Dent 1989;3). What seems to be lost with all the HA bashing is 
              that HA coatings on screw implants would offer the advantages of increased 
              compressive load capabilities of a threaded implant and take advantage 
              of the higher percentage of bone contact (60%) compared to only 30% 
              with Br&aring;nemark machined surface and 50% with TPS-coated IMZ surface, 
              as reported by Dr. Holmes in the transcribed proceedings.</p>
            <p>The transcribed proceedings do not include the benefits of acid etching 
              the implant surface, a process Core-Vent Corporation has used since 
              1986 to remove machining contaminants and loose titanium particles. 
              Based on published research, acid etching of the titanium surface as 
              a cleaning and roughening procedure deserves consideration in any scientific 
              debate related to implant surface treatments, especially in light of 
              the studies that document loose titanium particles that become imbedded 
              in the adjacent tissues with machined surface (Schliephake H, JOMI 1993;8) 
              and TPS surfaces (Strub JR, JOMI 1987;4).</p>
