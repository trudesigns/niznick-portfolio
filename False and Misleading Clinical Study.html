            <p>Dear Dr. Lang:</p>
            <p><b>SUBJECT:</b> Invalidity of the study by De Bruyn, Albrektsson et 
              al., entitled &quot;Clinical outcome of Screw-Vent implants– A 7-year 
              prospective follow-up study&quot; 1999 Clinical Oral Implant Research 
              1: 139-148, (&quot;De Bruyn, Albrektsson 1999 study&quot;). </p>
            <p><b>HISTORY:</b> This is a follow-up study to a 1-year study published 
              in the same journal by De Bruyn et al. 1992 Clinical Oral Implants Research 
              3:32-41 (&quot;De Bruyn 1992 study&quot;) that reported on a comparison 
              of &quot;the clinical success of 85 Screw-Vent and 107 Branemark implants, 
              consecutively installed in a private periodontal clinic under the same 
              conditions and by the same operator.&quot; Unlike the 1999 study, the 
              original one included evaluation of Branemark implants placed by the 
              same periodontist. </p>
            <p><b>1999 STUDY CRITERIA:</b> claims to use a bone loss criteria of success 
              first proposed by Albrektsson et al (JOMI 1986) and later adopted by 
              the European Academy of Periodontology (Albrektsson &amp; Isidor 1994).</p>
            <b>
            <p>The validity of the De Bruyn, Albrektsson 1999 study deserves close 
              scrutiny for these reasons:</p>
            </b>
            <ol>
              <li>Co-author, Thomas Albrektsson (MD) is a paid consultant and/or spokesman 
                for Nobel Biocare, a company selling competing products to Paragon’s 
                Screw-Vent Implant.</li>
              <li>Albrektsson devised the success criteria that includes a bone loss 
                parameter and, in this study, applies these criteria to conclude that 
                &quot;the Screw-Vent implant does not meet with the success criteria&quot;. 
              </li>
              <li>Albrektsson, as a non-dentist and, had no involvement with conducting 
                the clinical aspects of this study, and was not a co-author of the 
                original comparative study – why is he now involved with this study?</li>
              <li>The De Bruyn 1999 &quot;7-year prospective follow-up study&quot; 
                reported on 85 Screw-Vent implants first reported in De Bruyn 1992 
                article, but excludes the 107 Branemark implants. The explanation 
                given by the authors for this exclusion is that "…we felt that plenty 
                of evidence is available to validate the Branemark system.&quot; <b>No 
                references are offered in support of this assertion. </b></li>
              <li>A search of the literature has not revealed any published studies 
                on the Br&aring;nemark implant that has utilized Albrektsson et al.'s 
                criterion of 0.2mm annual crestal bone loss. Adell et al.’s 15-year 
                (<i>Int J Oral Surg</i> 1981) and 20-year (<i>JOMI</i> 1990) reports, 
                and Zarb’s 9-year report (<i>Int J Perio Rest Dent</i> 1991) do not 
                utilize bone loss as a criterion for determining the success of Br&aring;nemark 
                implants. Albrektsson et al. (<i>Int J Prosthodont</i> 1993) acknowledge 
                that the 20-year report on the Br&aring;nemark implant by Adell et 
                al. (<i>JOMI</i> 1990) &quot;did not, for practical reasons, make 
                individual radiograms, nor did they perform individual stability controls 
                in every long-term follow-up patient." </li>
              <li>The subsequent replication study of the Br&aring;nemark research 
                (Chaytor &amp; Zarb, <i>Int J Periodont Rest Dent</i> 1991) calculated 
                marginal bone change as an average of bone losses and bone gains over 
                time, but did not include bone loss as a criterion of implant success. 
                While one later study of Br&aring;nemark implants placed in 50 patients 
                (Zarb &amp; Schmitt, <i>JADA</i> 1996) states that annual follow-up 
                examinations included tests for implant mobility and soft tissue attachment 
                in accordance with the proposed Albrektsson et al. success criteria 
                (<i>JOMI</i> 1986), implant survival (i.e. osseointegration) was the 
                only criterion utilized to determine implant success in the study.</li>
              <li>Selectively applying Albrektsson et al.'s success criterion to a 
                competitor's implant without applying the same criterion to the Br&aring;nemark 
                implants placed in the same study is an established tactic of Br&aring;nemark 
                spokesperson, Sennerby (<i>JOMI</i> 1990), when he was a graduate 
                student of Albrektsson, which has been criticized in the literature 
                (Niznick, <i>JOMI</i> 1990).</li>
              <li>The Br&aring;nemark researchers calculated bone loss from the subcrestal 
                base of a 2-mm-deep countersink preparation (Adell et al., <i>Int 
                J Oral Surg</i> 1981), rather than from the crest of the ridge at 
                the time of implant placement, and those measurements did not commence 
                until one year after the implant was loaded with the prosthesis. In 
                the present study by De Bruyn, Albrektsson et al., bone loss was measured 
                only for the Screw-Vent implant, and was calculated from the crest 
                of the ridge at the time of implant placement. </li>
              <li>Albrektsson et al.'s criterion of 0.2mm annual bone loss after the 
                first year in function (<i>JOMI</i> 1986) is not only based on average 
                bone loss measurements made from the base of the countersink (Adell 
                et al., <i>Int J Oral Surg</i> 1981), but also exclusively derived 
                from implants splinted cross-arch in the symphysis of completely edentulous 
                jaws (Br&aring;nemark et al., <i>Tissue-Integrated Prostheses</i> 
                1985). The reality is that periimplant crestal bone loss is an extremely 
                complex phenomenon that can be caused by many different factors, including 
                surgical trauma, inappropriate selection of implant size and location 
                of placement, smoking habits of patients, excessive loading conditions 
                and microbial infections, to name a few. Crestal bone change can range 
                between bone losses and bone gains over time (Chaytor &amp; Zarb, 
                <i>Int J Periodont Rest Dent</i> 1991; Manz, <i>JOMS</i> 1997;55,Suppl 
                5), and are thus not necessarily indicators of either implant success 
                or implant failure.</li>
              <li>Although a number of published studies reference the Albrektsson 
                criteria of success that included no greater bone loss than 0.2mm 
                annually after the first year in function, none exist where bone loss 
                exceeding the recommended minimum acceptable level was used as a determining 
                factor in judging an individual implant a clinical failure. To date, 
                the Albrektsson bone loss criterion has only been applied to implants 
                that compete with the Br&aring;nemark implant by either Albrektsson, 
                or Sennerby, both spokesmen for Nobel Biocare (JOMI 1990 Sennerby: 
                Evaluation of 43 Core-Vent Implants; Albrektsson, Int J Prosth. IMZ 
                implants and the current De Bruyn, Albrektsson study – Screw-Vent 
                Implants).</li>
              <li>The Albrektsson/Zarb Criteria of Success (Albrektsson T, Zarb G 
                et al. JOMI 1986) included a requirement that crestal bone loss be 
                &quot;less than 0.2mm annually <b>after the implant's first year of 
                service</b>.&quot; The De Bruyn 1999 study acknowledges in its first 
                paragraph that the De Bruyn 1992 study reported one-third of the examined 
                Screw-Vent implants &quot;showed bone loss between 2 and 4mm.&quot; 
                Instead of applying the criteria as stated, and using the individual 
                implant's bone loss measurement &quot;after the implant’s first year 
                of service&quot; as the baseline to determine whether a steady state 
                with no greater than an average of 0.2mm annually for subsequent years, 
                the De Bruyn 1999 study allowed an arbitrary 1.5mm for first year 
                bone loss. The De Bruyn 1999 study then </li>
              <p> added 0.2mm for each of the remaining 6 years of follow-up to reach 
                what it terms the </p>
              <p> &quot;critical bone loss value&quot; of &quot;2.7mm below abutment 
                implant junction, which </p>
              <p> corresponds by coincidence to the first implant thread&quot; of 
                the Screw-Vent implant.</p>
              <li>The De Bruyn 1992 study reported that, for the Branemark implant, 
                &quot;bone remodeling in the coronal part of the implant, up to the 
                1<sup>st</sup> implant thread.&quot; The article notes that the "non-threaded 
                area of the (Br&aring;nemark) fixture is 1.5mm up to the first thread.&quot; 
                With the Screw-Vent implant, De Bruyn 1992 observed &quot;the mean 
                1.7mm bone loss (Screw-Vent) is counted from the baseline radiographs 
                taken at the time of abutment connection, and <b>does not reflect 
                the real abutment-bone distance or bone loss prior to abutment connection... 
                The bone level is directed towards the first implant thread, about 
                2.7m mm below the implant-abutment interface. </b>&quot; </li>
              <li>Bone loss that takes place in the first year following placing the 
                implant in function was to be specifically excluded in applying the 
                Albrektsson Criteria to account for bone loss due to surgical trauma, 
                resorption of thin bone, or bone loss from excessive functional forces. 
                Its claimed objective was to ascertain if a steady state would be 
                reached by a particular implant design. The De Bruyn 1992 study points 
                out that with the "Screw-Vent implants, there is no need for countersinking 
                as with the Branemark System.&quot; Countersinking widens the opening 
                to the implant site, removing thin bone that would otherwise be lost 
                from resorption. The Screw-Vent (pre-1995) had a 2mm relatively smooth 
                neck created by acid etching the machined surface. </li>
              <li>The initial differences in bone loss from the Screw-Vent without 
                countersinking and the Branemark, with countersinking, would be accounted 
                for if the authors applied the Albrektsson 1986 criterion as stated: 
                &quot;less than 0.2mm annually after the implant's first year of service.&quot; 
                Instead, the authors arbitrarily allowed 1.5mm for the first year 
                bone loss for the Screw-Vent in spite of the fact that Albrektsson 
                was not only a co-author of this article but also of the criteria 
                applied by the article. The authors’ failure to properly apply the 
                criteria, and at the same time, to apply the same criteria to the 
                Branemark implants in the same study group, invalidate the study and 
                reveal the intentions of the authors to create a marketing attack 
                on one of Nobel Biocare’s competitors. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>This Technology Report is being prepared to evaluate the scientific 
              objectivity of this article, and to critically analyze the validity 
              of using the Albrektsson criteria of success that, as will be demonstrated, 
              has undergone repeated modifications since first proposed. (Albrektsson 
              et al., <i>JOMI</i> 1986). </p>
            <p>The core issue raised by the present De Bruyn, Albrektsson et al. article 
              (<i>COIR</i> 1999:10) is the legitimacy of applying the Albrektsson 
              et al. bone loss criteria to evaluate any implant system. De Bruyn, 
              Albrektsson et al. essentially assert that the Screw-Vent implants, 
              which were successfully osseointegrated and in function for 7 years, 
              must be called failures if bone recession occurs to the first thread. 
              By not applying the same criterion to the Br&aring;nemark implants placed 
              in the same study, the authors eschew the fact that the same degree 
              of crestal bone loss is routinely observed with Br&aring;nemark implants 
              (Adell et al., <i>Int J Oral Surg</i> 1981; Lindquist et al., <i>JPD</i> 
              1988). </p>
            <p>The De Bruyn 1999 article cites a number of references to support criticism 
              of the Screw-Vent implant’s design, surface and clinical efficacy, but 
              a review of these studies reveals an alarming discrepancy between what 
              the referenced articles actually state. Most readers rely on the honesty 
              of the authors and the thoroughness of the reviewers. The following 
              comparisons of what the authors claim the reference reported, and what 
              they actually state, should serve as a shocking example of how researchers 
              or clinicians, affiliated with a company as a researcher and/or lecturer, 
              can disguise marketing rhetoric in the form of </p>
            <p>pseudoscience. Albrektsson, with financial ties to Nobel Biocare, has 
              demonstrated this type of intellectual dishonesty in many of his previously 
              published articles critical of Nobel Biocare’s competitors. He has done 
              it again in this article:</p>

            <p>The requirement that implants not exhibit more than 0.2mm of annual 
              crestal bone loss after the first year of placement as a criterion of 
              success was proposed in 1986 (Albrektsson, </p>
            <p>Zarb et al. JOMI 1986), by co-author, Dr. Tomas Albrektsson, a Nobel 
              Biocare consultant and spokesman. It has undergone a number of modifications 
              in published articles since that time although, to date, not a single 
              published study on the Br&aring;nemark implant that has ever utilized 
              the Albrektsson/Zarb criterion of crestal bone loss for determining 
              success or failure of a single implant. For example, Adell et al.’s 
              15-year (Int J Oral Surg 1981) and 20-year (JOMI 1990) reports, and 
              Zarb’s 9-year report (Int J Perio Rest Dent 1991) did not utilize bone 
              loss as a criterion for categorizing Br&aring;nemark implants as failures. 
              Albrektsson et al. (Int J Prosthodont 1993) admit that the 20-year report 
              on the Br&aring;nemark implant by Adell et al. (JOMI 1990;5:347) &quot;did 
              not, for practical reasons, make individual radiograms, nor did they 
              perform individual stability controls in every long-term follow-up patient. 
            </p>
            <p>The real issue raised by the De Bruyn, Albrektsson article is not the 
              bias of the authors, which is obvious from their inaccurate extrapolation 
              from various references to portray the Screw-Vent implant in a poor 
              light. It is the use of the Albrektsson bone loss criteria to evaluate 
              any implant system. The following history of this criteria and the illogic 
              of its application should provide a better understanding of how it’s 
              application serves no valid purpose.</p>
            <p>The De Bruyn, Albrektsson study established the benchmark level of 
              bone loss they say is acceptable for the Screw-Vent by adding 1.5mm 
              allowance for bone loss during the first year in function, and 0.2mm 
              for each of the 6 years of follow-up, for a maximum of 2.7mm, which 
              they acknowledge &quot;corresponds by co-incidence with the first implant 
              thread.&quot; The average bone loss was reported as being 2.92mm with 
              &quot;18 of 60 examined implants (30%) showed unacceptable radiological 
              bone loss beyond the critical value of 2.7mm.&quot; Therefore, bone 
              loss to or beyond the first thread was considered &quot;unacceptable.&quot;</p>
            <p>In contrast, bone loss with the Br&aring;nemark implant has been measured 
              from the base of the countersink (Adell 1981), which is 1.5mm from the 
              top of the implant. Br&aring;nemark, Albrektsson and Zarb (1985 Quintessence 
              Textbook, Pg 181) reported an additional &quot;1 to 1.5mm of marginal 
              bone was lost during the first year after bridge connection, mainly 
              as a response to the surgical trauma. This combined surgical removal 
              by countersinking and subsequent bone loss totals 3mm and results in 
              exposure of the first thread of the Branemark implant on a routine basis. 
              Countersinking the crestal bone for the Branemark implant has the effect 
              of widening the ridge by removing thin crestal bone that would eventually 
              resorb. The Screw-Vent implants, with necks narrower than their outside 
              threads, do not require countersinking, thereby preserving crestal bone 
              initially and allowing the bone to resorb naturally. </p>
            <p>Therefore, both the Branemark and Screw-Vent implants may lose bone 
              to the first thread (3mm from top on the Branemark implant and 2.7mm 
              from the top with the older Screw-Vent design used by De Bruyn) but 
              according to the Albrektsson criteria, the Screw-Vent design would be 
              considered a failure while the Branemark implant would be considered 
              a success. The article states that the Albrektsson criteria has been 
              accepted by the European Academy for Periodontology. The time has come 
              for such organizations to review the history of, and modifications to, 
              the Albrektsson criteria and question what purpose such criteria serve, 
              other than for clinicians and researchers affiliated with Nobel Biocare 
              to criticize competitors' products. </p>

              &quot;less than 0.2mm annually after the implant's first year of service.&quot; 
              The 0.2mm bone loss after the first year in function was </p>

                      the research criteria of annual bone loss to a single implant 
                      in a single year would have deprived most patients of at least 
                      2 additional years of service. Given that only 3 of the 63 implants 
                      in this group of 15 patients ever failed within the period of 
                      the study, the patients as a group would have been deprived 
                      of many years of satisfactory service form their implants.&quot;</p>

                    <p> &quot;Anyone who has worked with oral implants is aware that 
                      there are several implants that are difficult to categorize…the 
                      implant that shows an unacceptable, progressive resorption 2 
                      and 3 years after placement. This implant will then meet the 
                      failure criteria. However, there are clinical records in which 
                      a reconstructed prosthesis will result in cessation of the loss 
                      in bone height and hence the same implant may turn into a successful 
                      one.&quot;</p>
                    <p>&quot;Another problem with bone height measurements is related 
                      to the uncertainty in the radiographic evaluation. In the individual 
                      situation, <u>this uncertainty is substantial</u>.&quot; (emphasis 
                      added)</p>

            <p>The VA study measured thickness of labial plate at time of implant 
              placement and determined correlation between bone thickness and reduced 
              crestal resorption (in manuscript). One analysis of data from the VA 
              study (Manz M. Radiographic assessment of peri-implant vertical bone 
              loss: DICRG. J Oral Maxillofac Surg 1997;55(Suppl 5):62-71) confirmed 
              that bone loss was related to implant surface (less with HA coating 
              1/2mm from top), quality of bone (less in dense bone) and location in 
              the jaw (greater in thin bone in anterior maxilla). Given all the iatrogenic 
              causes of bone loss, many caused by inexperience of the surgeon, and 
              its relationship with surface roughness, bone quality and ridge thickness, 
              to judge an implant as meeting success criteria based on bone loss measurements 
              is ludicrous, especially when reported by relatively inexperienced clinicians 
              from one center with an affiliation to a competing company. Such reports 
              should not pass peer review, or for that matter, the smell test! </p>

                      no need for countersinking as with the Br&aring;nemark system…The 
                      bone level is directed towards the first implant thread, about 
                      2.7mm below the implant-abutment interface... <b>Bone remodeling 
                      up to the first fixture thread (for the Branemark implants) 
                      about 1.5mm below the abutment-fixture interface, is observed</b>...Obviously, 
                      bone apposition on unthreaded and smooth titanium surfaces is 
                      difficult to achieve.&quot; </p>

                    <p>The Branemark Implant is inserted with its 0.7mm external hex 
                      projection level with the bone following countersinking procedure 
                      which widens the crestal opening, removing thin bone and reducing 
                      the height of the ridge in the process of widening it. The first 
                      thread would therefore be 2.2mm below the surgically established 
                      crestal height which is even greater than if measured from the 
                      original crest of bone. </p>

                    <p>The Screw-Vent, used in the 1992 De Bruyn study, had a 2mm 
                      long, narrow neck that did not require countersinking. Therefore, 
                      when bone receded to the first thread (2.7mm below the implant 
                      top), there was, in reality, no greater bone loss than with 
                      the Br&aring;nemark implant. In 1995, the Screw-Vent design 
                      changed to shorten the neck by 0.5mm and bring up the first 
                      thread an additional 0.5mm, thereby equalizing the position 
                      of the first thread with that of the Br&aring;nemark implant. 
                      The length of the neck of the Screw-Vent is necessary to accommodate 
                      the 1.5mm deep internal hex. </p>
