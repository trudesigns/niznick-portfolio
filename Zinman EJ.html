                  1986</p>
                </b> 
                <p>In the June 1986 column, &quot;Dentists and the Law,&quot; by Dr. Edwin 
                  J. Zinman, the following question was posed by a dentist &quot;considering 
                  employing osseointegration&quot;: "If the patient is advised preoperatively 
                  [of the risk of failure], am I legally protected, since long-term research 
                  evidence now is available to prove the effectiveness of osteointegrated 
                  implants?"</p>
                <p>Apparently, Zinman has been misinformed as to the spelling, definition 
                  and research regarding osseointegration. The dentist was inquiring regarding 
                  osseointegration, not the &quot;Scandinavian device&quot; referred to 
                  by Dr. Zinman and currently marketed under the name &quot;Biotes&quot; 
                  or &quot;Br&aring;nemark Implant System.&quot; This is the only system 
                  that restricts sale to &quot;the select few specialists.&quot; Osseointegration 
                  is a term defined by Dr. P.-I. Br&aring;nemark [1] in 1984 as &quot;direct 
                  contact on the light-microscopic level between living bone tissue and 
                  the implant.&quot; It is a biological phenomenon, not a trademarked 
                  term, patented process, or unique physical occurrence specific to the 
                  implant used in the Swedish research. Since the Swedish clinical research 
                  did not evaluate different materials, designs, surfaces or insertion 
                  techniques in controlled studies, it can be interpreted as proving only 
                  the biological principle that a bone-titanium oxide interface, once 
                  established, offers the opportunity for long-term stability. The legacy 
                  of the Swedish research was stated in a recent article [2] by Albrektsson 
                  and Zarb (co-authors with Br&aring;nemark on a textbook on osseointegration): 
                  "The Br&aring;nemark results...clearly underscore the basic concept 
                  of osseointegration as being the major if not the exclusive reason for 
                  a successful long-term dental implant attachment."</p>
                <p>Dr. Zinman may be relying on Biotes’ marketing rhetoric rather than 
                  the published research in formulating his opinion as to the significance 
                  of the &quot;17-year success rate.&quot; Adell [3] reported on 4,100 
                  implants but, for reasons of statistical analysis, omitted 2,139 implants, 
                  including all of the implants with observation periods of greater than 
                  ten years. A review of the statistics of the first six years of clinical 
                  research [4] reveal a 62% failure rate in the upper jaw and 35% failure 
                  in the lower jaw. Of the 1,961 implants reported by Adell, 944 had observation 
                  times of one to four years, and it was this short-term segment of the 
                  study that is often referred to as representative of the entire research 
                  period, as evidenced by Br&aring;nemark’s published statement [5] in 
                  a press release:</p>
                <p>&#9;In 20 years of clinical testing, Biotes has been 99 percent successful 
                  in the lower jaw and 95 percent successful in the upper jaw.</p>
                <p>I take issue with Dr. Zinman’s pejorative comments characterizing other 
                  osseointegrated implants as &quot;newer experimental implant devices&quot; 
                  and as &quot;copycats,&quot; &quot;clones,&quot; or &quot;imitation 
                  implants.&quot; The Core-Vent Implant, introduced in 1982 and covered 
                  by US patent #4,431,416, has been referred to as &quot;conceptually 
                  unique&quot; by Albrektsson, Zarb et al. [2]. This article also stated 
                  that the &quot;...Br&aring;nemark implantation procedure has been...criticized 
                  for being complicated and expensive.&quot; The Core-Vent Implant offers 
                  the predictability of osseointegration, simplified surgical procedures, 
                  and versatile prosthetic applications –– at a cost that is affordable 
                  to both dentist and patient.</p>
                <p>The Core-Vent Implant is now in its fifth year of clinical use. Animal 
                  research [6] and a human specimen [7] evaluated histologically after 
                  being in function for two years confirm that the Core Vent Implant achieves 
                  osseointegration. Clinical results of 100 consecutively placed Core-Vent 
                  Implants were reported by Lubar and Katin [8], with 98% achieving and 
                  maintaining osseointegration over a three-year period (57 had been in 
                  function for at least two years). The fact that the Core-Vent System 
                  is user-friendly was confirmed by Messer et al. [9], who reported on 
                  the achievement of osseointegration with all the first 25 Core-Vent 
                  Implants placed, with only two failing to integrate with the first 60 
                  [10]. Patrick [11] reported a 97% incidence of osseointegration with 
                  250 Core-Vent Implants.</p>
                <p>Informed Consent: Dr. Zinman pointed out in his August 1985 column 
                  in Dental Management that &quot;Some courts have viewed literature-supported 
                  success rates as misleading if the treating dentist’s success rate differs 
                  markedly.&quot; He has, therefore, answered the question of whether 
                  a dentist, just starting the Swedish system with little or no clinical 
                  experience of his own, can infer to his patients that he will achieve 
                  the same success rate as the researchers who inserted thousands of implants. 
                  Adell’s published research reported on Br&aring;nemark implants placed 
                  in the anterior of edentulous jaws to support fixed bridges, and does 
                  not necessarily translate to other locations or applications. Albrektsson 
                  et al. [2], referring to the Br&aring;nemark implant, said, &quot;The 
                  placement of osseointegrated dental implants posterior to the mental 
                  foramina must be regarded as experimental, since no five-year results 
                  have been published for such implants...the use of the Br&aring;nemark 
                  screw as an individual replacement is, so far, based on anecdotal reporting 
                  exclusively.&quot;</p>
                <p>Standard of Care: Another legal issue raised by Dr. Zinman’s comments 
                  is that of standard of care. Approximately 60 universities and teaching 
                  hospitals and over 3,000 general dentists and surgical specialists are 
                  using the Core-Vent System; one recent market analysis gave it a greater 
                  than 50% share of the entire implant market. If the selection of an 
                  implant system is to be a legal issue rather than the following of the 
                  surgical protocol prescribed for the system chosen, then Core-Vent could 
                  arguably be the standard of care by the predominance of its use. </p>
                <p>Practicing dentists should base decisions about implantology on published 
                  research and the clinical experiences of their colleagues, rather than 
                  on legal intimidation based on misinformation. DM</p>
