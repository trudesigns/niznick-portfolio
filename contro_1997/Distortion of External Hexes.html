                  Paragon claims that its system is simplified, but still provides many 
                  designs to choose from. What is it about the new Advent that you think 
                  will simplify treatment for me? Where would I use the Micro-Vent vs. 
                  the Screw-Vent?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  In today's dental practice, implant dentistry must be relatively simple 
                  and economical for both the surgeon and the restorative dentist. One-stage 
                  implants reduce patient trauma, shorten chair time and lower costs by 
                  eliminating the second-stage surgery. Reducing the number of surgical 
                  instruments needed to prepare the implant site and refining the implant 
                  packaging will also simplify and shorten surgical time. For simplified 
                  prosthetics, reducing the number of implant platforms and designing 
                  abutments for cemented restorations without shoulders will reduce the 
                  number of abutment options needed. These design criteria must be weighted 
                  against the versatility and esthetic issues needed to meet the demands 
                  of varied clinical applications. The evolution from the old to the new 
                  designs may cause some concerns about too many options. However, below 
                  is a description of the newer designs and the benefits to clinicians 
                  in making the transition. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>ADVENT IMPLANT</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AdVent" implant features 
                  self-tapping, triple lead threads that make seating three times faster. 
                  Implant Extender packaging provided with the AdVent allows it to be 
                  placed via a one- or two-stage procedure, which the surgeon can decide 
                  at the time of placement. One-stage implants in edentulous jaws can 
                  be immediately splinted cross-arch to provide adequate stability for 
                  immediate loading with overdentures. A simple ball screw converts the 
                  top of the implant into a ball overdenture abutment and friction-fit 
                  straight and tapered abutments can also be attached for cemented restorations. 
                  The tapered body of the AdVent creates compression in soft bone for 
                  increased initial stability, a fundamental requirement to achieve osseointegration. 
                  This patented insertion procedure also will expand narrow ridges, eliminating 
                  the need for 3.3mm small diameter implant. The 3.7mmD and 4.7mmD AdVent 
                  implants have the same platform for the ultimate in abutment selection 
                  simplicity. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>TAPERED MICRO-VENT<sup>2</sup> 
                  IMPLANT</b></font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A tapered implant is particularly 
                  suited for immediate replacement of extracted teeth. The tapered Micro-Vent<sup>2</sup> 
                  implant, available in diameters of 3.7mm, 4.7mm and 5.7mm, features 
                  Paragon’s patented internal hex and a unique tap-in/screw-in surgical 
                  protocol. The tapered design is also helpful for placement between convergent 
                  tooth roots and in ridges with labial concavities. The Micro-Vent<sup>2</sup> 
                  has a rounded, closed bottom that facilitates sinus elevation procedures. 
                  The implant features Paragon’s patented Dual Transition Selective Surface, 
                  which provides 1mm of smooth, machined neck, with 2mm of a blasted zone 
                  between the smooth neck and HA or TPS coated body. The apical end is 
                  also machined to allow efficient self-tapping of the final 3mm of the 
                  implant’s insertion. Because only the apical 8mm of the Micro-Vent<sup>2</sup> 
                  is tapered, one drill can be used to place all four implant lengths. 
                  The Micro-Vent<sup>2</sup> also features new Fixture Mount/Transfer 
                  packaging that allows stage-one transfer impressions. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Screw-Vent implant, introduced 
                  in 1986, was the world’s first implant to have an internal, anti-rotational

                  spaced every 0.6mm apart. It has both an apical cross-vent, and a vertical 
                  vent coming up from the apex that connects with the cross-vent. The 
                  straight body of the Screw-Vent is offered in three surfaces, HA, TPS 
                  and SBM (blasted), all with a relatively smooth, machined apical end

                  For 10 years I used only two-stage implants. For the past three years, 
                  I have used single-stage implants. I am very pleased with the results 
                  that I have been getting and patients are obviously getting off better 
                  by only having to have one surgery as opposed to two. Our success rates 
                  have remained above 95% with single-stage implants, as well. I find 
                  the restorative aspects of treatment to be much easier with a single-stage 
                  system. I was wondering if anyone out there is having similar experiences? 
                  I really think that this is the future of implant dentistry. Many of 
                  the manufacturers are making single-stage implants (some aren't on the 
                  market yet), such as 3i, Imtec (in the works), etc.</font></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  You are right about the advantages of single-stage implants. Straumann’s 
                  recent addition of an internal octagon to the ITI internal conical connection 
                  further suggests that a non-hexed (or non-octagon) abutment connection, 
                  without the ability to do transfers, had distinct limitations in the 
                  esthetic zone. Still, the ITI system will not be manufacturing abutments 
                  that cover the implant shoulder so that the dentist can prepare the 
                  margins to follow the contours of the tissue. However, this could be 
                  accomplished with custom-cast abutments that are now possible, because 
                  of stage-one surgery transfer capabilities. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem Straumann now 
                  has, with its new design, is that it violates Paragon's internal anti-rotational 
                  patent that has been successfully enforced against Steri-Oss, Lifecore, 
                  3i, Calcitek and four other companies. Paragon has initiated litigation 
                  against Straumann in Los Angeles Federal Court. In 1993, Paragon sued 
                  Straumann for infringing its Core-Vent patent on an implant design that 
                  features a basket and threads — and won. Straumann was enjoined to stop 
                  selling its most popular implant for six months until it signed a licensing 
                  agreement. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3i copied Straumann's original 
                  conical connection and I anticipate that Lifecore's new one-stage implant 
                  will do the same. Due to previous litigation, both of these companies 
                  are locked into the old design. Straumann apparently is willing to risk 
                  its entire U.S. market by switching to the new design with an internal 
                  octagon and subject themselves, once again, to an injunction that could 
                  stop them from selling the very implants they are now marketing as the 
                  next generation of ITI implants. Since the patent covers the abutments 
                  that fit into an internal wrench-engaging surface, Straumann may be 
                  stopped from even selling abutments for the new connection —including 
                  implants that will have already been sold and placed. Paragon is starting 
                  production of ITI implant clones and abutments in anticipation of this 
                  outcome. Packaged together with the cover screw and abutment/transfer, 
                  Paragon's clone represents a 70% savings compared to buying ITI’s implants, 
                  cover screws, abutments and transfers separately.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are interested in 
                  improved designs, Paragon's new AdVent one-stage implant deserves your 
                  attention. It offers the same fluted neck design as the ITI implant, 
                  with an internal hex for attachment of preparable, friction-fit abutments 
                  that fit flush to the outside of the implant. It is packaged with a 
                  cover screw that eliminates the need to buy Straumann's 1mm cap screw 
                  ($20), and also is packaged with a 2 mm Implant Extender (Patent Pending) 
                  that eliminates the need to buy Straumann's 2mm-5mm cap screws ($40). 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The AdVent's design, surgical 
                  protocol and packaging allow the surgeon to place the implant 1mm above 
                  the crest for two-stage surgery or 2mm–5mm above the crest for one-stage 
                  surgery. The AdVent’s body has Paragon's patented triple lead threads 
                  for three-times faster insertion compared to the standard threads on 
                  Branemark, Screw-Vent, 3i, Lifecore, Calcitek and other implants. AdVent’s 
                  patented insertion protocol allows insertion of a tapered implant into 
                  a straight hole for bone expansion/compression in soft bone and added 
                  stability in dense bone. Unlike the ITI, AdVent is self-tapping, which 
                  further saves chair time. </font></p>

                  I met with two of your representatives today. They were both really 
                  nice guys and knowledgeable, as well. The AdVent implant looks great...no 
                  question. The dilemma that I spoke to them about has to do with the 
                  fact that referring general dentists, for the most part, are already 
                  "lost" when it comes to implant restorative concepts. Most have been 
                  inundated with various systems, abutments, and impression techniques. 
                  Due to the lack of Continuing Education specific to particular implant 
                  systems, they are often baffled by the various techniques employed by 
                  the different systems. I'm not saying that many of these dentists are 
                  good dentists, in fact, quite the opposite. Because of the simplicity 
                  that the ITI system affords, the average general dentist in our area 
                  is quite reluctant to switch again to a new system due to difference 
                  in restorative procedures and the fact that many of these dentists have 
                  already purchased lab analogs, impression transfers, torque wrenches, 
                  and on and on. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The problem of educating 
                  all of these referral doctors, getting them finally comfortable with 
                  a simple system and equipped is nothing short of a monumental task. 
                  Even though I can see some definite advantages to the AdVent system, 
                  I really feel compelled to stay with this status quo because everybody 
                  is happy! On the other hand, I'm very eager to see Paragon’s ITI clone. 
                  I mentioned to the two sales guys that it would really be nice if this 
                  clone has the same threading and taper as the AdVent. Is this the case? 
                  </font></p>

                  The clone implant, which is called the SwissPlus, has better packaging 
                  than the ITI implant. Its fixture mount engages the octagon and can 
                  be used for both a transfer and for insertion (and easy removal of the 
                  fixture mount without counter-torque). The fixture mount fits flush 
                  with the outside diameter of the implant shoulder, and is tapered so 
                  that it can also be used as an abutment. Margins can be prepared in 
                  the abutment to follow the contour of the soft tissue. SwissPlus implants 
                  are available in 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm and 14mm lengths, and in 4.1 mm 
                  and 4.8 mm diameters that share a common standard-diameter platform. 
                  The implants have our SBM surface that creates similar roughness to 
                  ITI's SLA surface, but without as much rounding of the threads. They 
                  also have a self-tapping groove in the apical end to further simplify 
                  insertion. All of Straumann's drills and abutments fit the SwissPlus 
                  implant. SwissPlus IS PRICED AT ONLY $165, which includes a 2mm cap 
                  screw and the fixture mount that serves as a transfer and abutment.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you attach the abutments 
                  for your restorative dentists, they don't even need a torque wrench 
                  or hex tool. They will not have to buy protective caps for the Octabutments, 
                  because the SwissPlus comes with a healing collar. They won't have to 
                  buy transfer jigs and abutment analogs, because they can take an impression 
                  of the Fixture Mount/Transfer and pour it in dental stone. This provides 
                  additional savings of laboratory charges which, combined with the surgical 
                  design advantages (i.e. self-tapping, bone compression, fast insertion 
                  and free cap screw/healing collar with 1-5mm adjustable heights), makes 
                  the SwissPlus a compelling product. If the surgeon attaches the abutment, 
                  the 5-year guarantee against loose screws must be a serious consideration. 
                  It is the job of our sales representatives to make your restorative 
                  dentists feel comfortable. We will exchange any unused Straumann parts 
                  they have for Paragon prosthetic components free of charge. </font></p>

                  octagon and abutments that fit both the clone and the ITI implant with 
                  the internal octagon platform. If doctors uses abutments from one system 
                  with implants from another, who are they going to blame if the abutment 
                  fails after loading? The warranty problem with all these clones is a 
                  difficult one for the dentist! You save some dollars in the beginning.

                  My company guarantees against fractures of all its components for 10 
                  years. We would aslo do so with the SwissPlus abutments, whether used 
                  with our implant or ITI’s. Paragon provides a 5-year guarantee against 
                  abutment screw loosening and the consequential need to remake a fixed 
                  prosthesis for cases that use our implants and friction-fit abutments. 
                  This includes paying any associated laboratory costs. Furthermore, in 
                  the U.S., Germany, Canada and Israel where we do not sell through distributors, 
                  we will also pay $100 per abutment to compensate for lost chair time. 
                  That is how sure we are that a fixation screw on a friction-fit, two-piece 
                  abutment will not come loose. We are the only company in the industry 
                  that makes such a guarantee, because we are the only one with a friction-fit, 
                  anti-rotational connection for both our internal and external hex implants. 
                  The SwissPlus abutments provide the stability of an internal, anti-rotational 
                  connection, but are not friction-fit, because the fixture mount must 
                  be easily detached in order to serve as both a transfer and an abutment. 
                  Therefore, it can not be covered by Paragon’s &quot;No Loose Screw&quot; 
                  guarantee.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The titanium Fixture Mount/Transfer 
                  engages the internal octagon, and is tapered so that it can be used 
                  as a transfer or as the final preparable abutment with margins to the 
                  outside of the implant. We would not want a fixture mount to be frictionally 
                  fit, or it could disturb the initial stability of the implant on removal. 
                  With the conical connection of the ITI implant, abutment loosening with 
                  multiple-unit splinting has not been a problem. With single tooth replacements, 
                  however, it should be a concern, as with any system that does not provide 
                  anti-rotational resistance through mating hexes. With ITI’s introduction 
                  of an internal octagon, stability will be a consideration for the engagement 
                  of two-piece, screw-retained, custom-cast abutments. The abutment must 
                  slip into the internal conical shaft to engage the octagon, and then 
                  be held in place by the screw. In contrast, one-piece abutments are 
                  tightened down with intimate contact along the internal tapered shaft. 
                  The ITI two-piece angled abutment has similar limitations to stability, 
                  as evident from the manufacturer's instructions not to grind on this 
                  abutment in the mouth, because vibrations will loosen it. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The SwissPlus is a complete 
                  system that includes the implant and abutment together in one package 
                  at a price that saves as much as 60% of the ITI costs—that is better 
                  for the user! It provides a Fixture Mount/Abutment that engages the 
                  internal octagon and does not need counter-torque for removal—which 
                  is better for the user! The Fixture Mount/Abutment is tapered and designed 
                  for use as a transfer—which is better for the user! It can also be used 
                  as the abutment with a diameter that extends to cover the shoulder of 
                  the implant. This allows the dentist to prepare margins to follow the 
                  soft tissue contour, and then make a conventional impression — that 
                  is better for the user! If one wants to still buy ITI-type solid abutments, 
                  Octabutments, transfers and abutment analogs, they are all compatible 
                  with the SwissPlus. Paragon’s solid-type abutment for the SwissPlus 
                  is available in the most popular height and sells at half the price 
                  of the ITI abutment — which is good for the user!</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have decided to take this 
                  action because Straumann decided to clone my patented connection. They 
                  are now being sued in Los Angeles Federal Court for cloning my internal 
                  connection. Straumann made the decision to do this because they finally 
                  realized that an internal connection is necessary for the prosthetic 
                  versatility with their system. I am cloning the ITI implants because

                  Guess what, Jerry? The external hex works! Look at the market distribution 
                  in the states. If the internal hex is so great, how do you account for 
                  the popularity of external hex implants?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  The high number of companies selling external hex implants or external 
                  splines is due primarily to my success in enforcing the internal hex 
                  patent. Steri-Oss, 3i, Lifecore, Calcitek and five other companies have 
                  unsuccessfully attempted to produce internally hexed implants that did 
                  not infringe. Straumann and Friatec, the most popular implant in Germany 
                  and perhaps Europe, both have an internal hexes/octagons and are now 
                  in litigation for probable infringement. Astra added an internal hex 
                  below its internal threads and has been warned of possible infringement. 
                  All these companies can’t be wrong about wanting and needing an internal 
                  hex/octagon (or any other shape of anti-rotational) connection. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I don't doubt that using 
                  stronger screws and greater torque, along with greater attention to 
                  occlusal forces, have reduced the number of screws loosening. But why 
                  not just eliminate the cause of loose screws and then move on to solve 
                  other problems in implant dentistry. Wobbling between mating parts can't 
                  be a good thing! By going internal, especially with a lead-in bevel 
                  and an internal hex that extends 1.5 mm below the bevel, 2 mm of interdigitation 
                  is achieved. Imagine an external hex that projected up 2 mm — it would 
                  be next to impossible to bury the implant or restore it with angled 
                  abutments. The internal hex allows for narrower necks on the implant 
                  and eliminates the need for countersinking. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The other half of the equation 
                  to a good connection is the design of the abutment. With the internal 
                  hex, Core-Vent designed and patented a tapered male hex that friction-fits 
                  into the implant and eliminates all rotational and tipping movements. 
                  In fact, Paragon guarantees no loose screws for 5 years under cemented 
                  restorations. We also make an implant with a tapered external hex (Taper-Lock) 
                  so that we can get the same friction-fit that guarantees no loose screws.

                  a long flight from New York to England in a 747, you would not want 
                  to start out with one dead engine. Sure, you can fly there with three 
                  good engines, but you never know when you are going to lose another 
                  engine and need the back-up of the one that was not working before you 
                  took off. It’s the same with implant restorations. Why start out with 
                  an unstable connection and depend on the torque or material of the screw 
                  to hold it together for the next 10-20 years?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The literature is full of 
                  articles documenting loose screw complications. Ask yourself why, for 
                  example, if 3i solved the problem of loose screws by the use of a gold 
                  screw or by using their claimed tighter tolerances "ZR" abutments, are 
                  they now introducing narrow implants with a wide platform they say is 
                  necessary to reduce screw loosening? Loose screws were listed by a panel 
                  of dentists in a 1994 issue of JOMI (Volume 9 Supplement) as the &quot;number 
                  one problem&quot; in implant dentistry. You may not be experiencing 
                  screw loosening in the short-term by changing to a stronger screw, but 
                  metal fatigue is a time-dependent factor and you may just be delaying 
                  the problem. Surgeons that work with restorative dentists have no idea 
                  whether the screw will be adequately tightened, whether the prosthesis 
                  will fit passively or if the occlusion is acceptable. For this reason, 
                  loose screws may be a bigger problem in the Team Approach than when 
                  one dentist is doing both surgery and prosthetics. </font></p>

                  solution to one problem in implant dentistry, such as friction-fit abutments 
                  that end loose screws, or the use of titanium alloy implants of adequate 
                  diameter to end breakage, incorporate it into your procedures and move 
                  on to discover other problems that need solutions. Otherwise, your problems 
                  become cumulative. While Steri-Oss is an alternative to Lifecore, one 
                  must first ask what problems are not being met by the Lifecore system 
                  and which system addresses these problems. In other words, you may be 
                  trading one set of problems for another. This is what it means to be

                  to the hex. Wouldn’t be be more effective to increase the size of the 
                  hex to prevent this from happening? I believe that a larger hex could 
                  also offer more to work with prosthetically. </font></p>

                  The rounding of the external hex is not due to its size as much as the 
                  metal used in the implant. Paragon's Taper-Lock external hex uses work-hardened 
                  commercially pure Grade 4 titanium with a Minimum Tensile Strength of 
                  132 ksi. Grade 3 Ti (used by 3i and Lifecore) only offers 65 ksi and 
                  Grade 1 Ti (used by Nobel Biocare) has 35 ksi. The advantage of the 
                  smaller standard hex (0.7mm on a 4.1mmD platform) is that it works for 
                  smaller diameter implants. Paragon's Taper-Lock uses this standard platform 
                  for its 3.3mmD, 4.1mmD and 4.7mmD external hex implants. The patented 
                  friction-fit created by tapering the external hex provides stability 
                  without the need to use a wide platform. </font></p>

                  To quell customer concerns of possible infringement, some Steri-Oss 
                  employees are apparently claiming that Steri-Oss was given a license 
                  by Core-Vent that would cover the internal connection of the Replace 
                  Select implant. Core-Vent/Paragon denies that it ever agreed that Steri-Oss 
                  was free to infringe its patent. Paragon’s attorney has put Nobel Biocare 
                  on notice to withdraw this product from the market because it infringes 
                  the Niznick Patent. The parties have agreed to proceed with arbitration 
                  on the issue. Federal judges in two previous patent suits have interpreted 
                  the claims of the Niznick patent to encompass anything internal that 
                  can be used to twist, turn or hold the implant, if lying within the 
                  internally threaded shaft of the implant. The decision by Nobel Biocare/Steri-Oss 
                  to launch new products that clearly infringe the Niznick patent is an 
                  acknowledgment of the advantages of the internal connection implant 
                  products that Paragon has sold since 1986. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobel Biocare also recently 
                  introduced an internal "Stargrip" in their Mk III and Mk IV implants. 
                  This is nothing more than squaring off the points of the hex. In doing 
                  so, it violates the Niznick patent, as it is an internal wrench engaging 
                  design within the internal shaft of their external hex implant. Infringement 
                  by the Stargrip feature is also an issue that will be resolved by arbitration, 
                  shortening the time that it would take compared to litigation in Federal 
                  Court. This "innovation" by Nobel Biocare merely confirms the value 
                  of the internal wrench-engaging design, first introduced in 1986 by 
                  Core-Vent. With this internal wrench engaging design, Nobel Biocare 
                  can now carry the implant to the prepared osteotomy without having to 
                  attach a fixture mount. This is no different than what was done with 
                  Core-Vent's internal hex implants between 1986 and 1990, prior to developing 
                  the first fixture mount packaging. </font></p>

                  Replace Select implant in its recent advertisement as being a one-stage 
                  implant. To accomplish this, they must leave the neck of the implant 
                  2 mm above the crest, which brings the HA and TPS coated threads almost 
                  to the crest of the ridge, increasing the risk of exposure to the oral 
                  cavity. Nobel Biocare/Steri-Oss must then sell its customers a healing 
                  collar to extend through the soft tissue. Paragon’s Advent is a true 
                  one-stage implant with a 3mm neck extension and an optional implant 
                  extender to accomodate for different tissue thickness. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The internal implant connection 
                  is only half the story in terms of achieving stability and preventing 
                  screw loosening. Paragon has a patent on friction-fit abutments created 
                  by tapering the male hex 1-degree. It requires 30 Ncm to seat the abutment 
                  and in so doing, the parts are cold-welded together, as demonstrated 
                  in an article by Binon (Postgraduate Dent 1996;3[1]), available on Paragon's 
                  web site or in hard copy by contacting the company. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nobel Biocare's advertisements 
                  for the Replace Select state that now they are giving dentists what 
                  they want—an internal connection! Does this mean Nobel Biocare/Steri-Oss 
                  has been very successful in selling dentists what they don't want—external 
                  hex implants? I believe that dental professionals are waking up to the 
                  fact that they should not only want, but need an internal connection 
                  implant for increased stability, reduced height and better tactile sense 
                  when seating the abutments. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It should be obvious that 
                  dental professionals and manufacturers are waking up to the advantages 
                  of using an internal connection implant. Straumann recently added an 
                  internal octagon to its conical connection, calling it synOCTA and referring 
                  to it as the &quot;Next Generation Implant.&quot; Their tradeshow booths 
                  portray them as innovators in a world of imitators, but they have already 
                  lost one patent suit to Core-Vent (threaded basket implant in 1994), 
                  and are now being sued for infringing the Niznick internal connection 
                  patent. Although they added an internal octagon, their fixture mounts 
                  still do not engage it for insertion. This design was most likely made 
                  under the false assumption that it avoids infringement. They still use 
                  the solid abutment, and leave the shoulder exposed to complicate impression 
                  procedures. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paragon has introduced an 
                  implant called SwissPlus, which clones the infringing ITI platform. 
                  This implant can be put in with all of ITI's drills and will accept 
                  ITI abutments. Unlike, syn-Octa, SwissPlus is self-tapping and comes 
                  packaged with a preattached Fixture Mount/Transfer that engages the 
                  octagon and covers the implant’s shoulders. This allows it to also be 
                  used as a transfer and a final preparable abutment for cemented restorations. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Astra added a 12-sided double 
                  hex and has been put on notice of infringement. Calcitek, Lifecore and 
                  3i have all been stopped from selling internal connections by previous 
                  Core-Vent litigation. In an act of desperation, Nobel Biocare decided 
                  to finally give dentists what they want instead of continuing to manipulate 
                  them into using the external hex implants through paid opinion leaders 
                  and purchased university endorsements. Core-Vent has been the lone voice 
                  in the industry for over a decade, educating dentists to the advantages 
                  of a well designed internal connection. Just as Calcitek's attempt at 
                  marketing a short octagon didn't work, only time will tell if Nobel 
                  Biocare's Replace Select internal connection, which looks like a silhouette 
                  of Mickey Mouse with his big round ears, in fact proves to also be a 
                  "Mickey Mouse" connection. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I was at the IPS meeting 
                  in Chicago in August there was a table clinic showing Kirsch's new implant 
                  design that does look similar to the new Steri-Oss internal connection. 
                  I asked Steri-Oss about the possible infringement on Niznick's internal 
                  connections and they informed me they have a patent already on this 
                  design so there is no worry about any patent infringement concerns. 
                  My personal objection on this design since it is essentially a triangular 
                  connector you are limited in the rotation possibilities when truing 
                  to align the abutment head.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Kirsch, who for years promoted 
                  the intramobile element in his IMZ implant design, was asked several 
                  weeks ago at a meeting in Germany (sponsored by his new company) whether 
                  a hex, with its 6 flat sides, would have been a better design. He commented 
                  that it would, but Niznick's patent in the U.S. prevented him from doing 
                  so if he wanted to sell in this country. CamLog has now been put on 
                  notice that their 3-groove design also infringes. Paragon recently won 
                  summary judgment and obtained an injunction against a company called 
                  GIS that had three pointed grooves to insert the implant. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conclusion, It should 
                  now be apparent that the industry is being forced to play catch up with 
                  Paragon Implant Company (formerly Core-Vent Corporation) in implant 
                  designs, but are finding a mine field of patents to contend with. The 
                  disputes may settle with the payment of royalties that allow these companies 
                  to sell designs that provide internal connections that fall short of 
                  achieving the stability of Paragon's internal hex and friction-fit abutments. 
                  They may get blown up in this mine field and have to withdraw their 
                  products after telling dental professions that internal connections 
                  are really needed for transfer capabilities (Straumann) or better in 
                  stability and ease of use (Nobel Biocare). Time will tell, but dental 
                  professionals should resist being manipulated once again by these manufacturers 
                  who are trying to rapidly evolve their product lines to give "what every 
                  dentist wants," according to Nobel Biocare's latest ads. Paragon has 
                  been providing discerning dentists with internal hex implants since 
                  1986 and, along with friction-fit abutments, has stood the test of time 
                  in thousands of dental offices worldwide— and now with documented success 
                  in a multi-center study of 2800 Paragon implants conducted in dental 
                  clinics at 30 U.S. Veterans Administration hospitals and two universities.

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A: </b>Paragon's mission 
                  is to provide the best products at the lowest possible prices, and to 
                  add value by developing multi-use parts, such as fixture mounts that 
                  are transfers and/or abutments. Our goal is also to design systems that 
                  minimize the number of necessary ancillary parts. In contrast, other 
                  systems add complexity in order to sell more parts at higher prices. 
                  Paragon decided to compete on innovation and value, not on giveaways, 
                  practice promotion support and paid opinion leaders. Paragon has redefined 
                  customer support with our case registration program that bridges the 
                  communication gap between surgeons and restorative dentists by providing 
                  customer support on a case-by-case basis. Surgeons register their cases, 
                  then Paragon contacts their restorative dentists and provides them all 
                  the product and technical support that they need. Alternatively, Paragon 
                  has developed "click-to-chart" ordering that allows surgeons to easily 
                  identify and, if desired, order the prosthetic components for their 
                  restorative dentists, or for the surgeon's own use in attaching the 
                  abutments.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Surgical specialists need 
                  to look at whether the same amount of new business could have been generated 
                  by using Paragon's CD-ROM program to promote their practices one-on-one 
                  or in small groups without a whole-day, hands-on lecture. Paragon's 
                  "Paradigm Shift" concepts demonstrated in the CD-ROM teach surgical 
                  specialists the "how" and "why" of attaching the abutments for their 
                  referring dentists, which can be an effective means of practice promotion. 
                  If the surgeon attaches the abutment, all the restorative dentist needs 
                  to do is make an impression using conventional procedures. That doesn't 
                  require a hands-on course! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF 
                  USING PARAGON PRODUCTS</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If a surgeon contemplates 
                  switching $20,000 of his or her business from Paragon to 3i, for example, 
                  because 3i offers to support a training course, the surgeon will ultimately 
                  pay for the speaker in higher product costs. Here is the reality:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Introducing a new system 
                  to the office adds to inventory expenses and product confusion.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Surgical specialists need 
                  to identify the cost differences between the system they are currently 
                  using versus the new system they are considering. In addition, they 
                  must consider the costs of exposing their referring dentists to the 
                  new system. If surgical specialists pay the current price of $230 for 
                  3i's Osseotite® or Steri-Oss' Replace® external hex implants, 100 implants 
                  would cost them $23,000 compared to $12,100 for Paragon's Taper-Lock 
                  external hex implants (current price is $125 per implant). The difference 
                  represents a savings of $11,100, which is enough for a surgical specialist 
                  to sponsor three courses at $3000 each, plus travel expenses. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3.Systems need to be evaluated 
                  by surgical specialists for the likelihood of clinical success. 3i's 
                  smooth Osseotite® surface is less likely to be clinically successful 
                  in soft bone than Paragon's SBM™-blasted (medium rough) or HA-coated 
                  (rough) surfaces. If surgical specialists use an implant that is more 
                  likely not to achieve osseointegration or to lose it after the referring 
                  dentist has cemented the bridge, that will hurt their implant referral 
                  business much more than the cost of paying for a lecturer. NOT ALL IMPLANTS 
                  WORK EQUALLY WELL! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Systems need to be evaluated 
                  by the surgeon from the standpoint of complexity. Paragon has simplified 
                  the abutment selection process by redefining the emergence profile question 
                  (i.e. 3i and Steri-Oss have produced many variations in emergence profile 
                  healing collars, abutments and transfers, which adds complexity and 
                  cost for the restorative dentist). Paragon recognized that, where one 
                  would use a narrow implant, a narrow abutment is most likely indicated, 
                  and vise versa. Therefore, Paragon has developed components with a "standard" 
                  emergence profile for every implant platform, which is 1.0 mm wider 
                  than the platform itself. In addition, Paragon also offers "narrow" 
                  emergence profile components that match the implant platform diameter, 
                  as well as "wide" emergence profile components that are 2.0 mm wider 
                  than the platform. This simplifies the selection process and reduces 
                  the complexity and confusion for the restorative dentist. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Paragon has preparable, 
                  full-contour abutments compared to 3i, Steri-Oss and Friadent, which 
                  feature premachined margins. This also translates into less confusion 
                  and inventory in selecting abutments. It also further promotes the Paradigm 
                  Shift concept by allowing the surgeon to attach an abutment at second-stage 
                  without worrying about what cuff height to select, since the final tissue 
                  height can not be determined until after recession.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Paragon offers significant 
                  cost savings on abutments in comparison to 3i and Nobel Biocare/Steri-Oss. 
                  If surgical specialists are paying for the abutment, then their savings 
                  in not having to pay for a speaker will rapidly disappear. If it is 
                  restorative dentists who are paying for the abutment, then the lost 
                  profits from the higher parts cost will discourage future referrals. 
                  Straight abutments for cemented restorations on Taper-Lock implants 
                  cost only $55, about half what other major companies cost. </font></p>

                  it lacks an internal hex for transfers. That is the reason Straumann

                  screw-retained cases. For the $35 price, a ball screw converts the implant 
                  top into a ball abutment, which saves up to $100 per abutment over the 
                  other systems. </font></p>

                  the uncovering of an internal connection (Astra) vs. external hex (Branemark) 
                  implant showed a 20-minute savings in chair time per implant with the 
                  internal connection (Clin Implant Dent and Rel Res 1999;1[1]:17-26). 
                  Consider that, for every 100 external hex two-stage implants surgical 
                  specialists place, they could be spending over 30 hours more during 
                  the uncovering procedures alone than would be spent with internal hex 
                  implants! IF SURGICAL SPECIALISTS PLACED ONE-STAGE IMPLANTS, THEY COULD 
                  BE SAVING ABOUT 50 MINUTES PER IMPLANT OR APPROXIMATELY 80 HOURS OF 
                  ADDITIONAL TIME, ACCORDING TO THE STUDY. If this is used as a basis 
                  for calculating the cost of chair time, savings with Paragon's internal 
                  hex Screw-Vent, at $400 per hour, translates into $12,000 in savings 
                  by using an internal hex instead of an external hex two-stage implant. 
                  Using Paragon's one-stage AdVent implant amounts to over $30,000 in 
                  savings compared to using a two-stage external hex implant. CONTRAST

                  all implant fractures to the FDA in what is known as a Medical Device 
                  Report (MDR). Based on 
                  what has been reported to Core-Vent/Paragon, there have been approximately 
                  400 fractures for every 1,000,000+ implants that we have sold. Most 
                  of these fractures relate to our former small-diameter Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> 
                  implants that were made of commercially pure titanium and featured a 
                  3.5mmD neck. In 1994, we changed from Grade 3 to Grade 4 commercially 
                  pure titanium to substantially increase the strength of the implants. 
                  In contrast, Nobel Biocare reports a much higher number of fractures,

                  from 3.5mmD to 3.7mmD, which required the incorporation of a countersink

                  from Grade 4 CP Ti with a tensile strength of 112 
                  ksi. The external hex can withstand 19 in/lbs of torque for self-tapping insertion into dense 
                  bone (vs. 9 to 11 in/lbs for Grade 1 and Grade 3 CP Ti implants, 
                  respectively). Under 30-degree compressive force, the 4.0mmD implant 
                  body and titanium alloy fixation screw can withstand 408 lb. (vs. 158 to 284 lb. for Grade 
                  1 and Grade 3 CP. Ti implants, respectively). Taper-Lock's 
                  superior strength thus minimizes implant and screw fractures and allows 
                  the addition of an apical vent to harvest bone chips during self-tapping 
                  insertion. This apical vent design also preserves thread surface in 
                  contrast to the multiple deep apical grooves used by some competitors.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The minute number of fractures 
                  among small-diameter Paragon implants after years of function is more 
                  indicative of occlusal overloading than an "inherent design defect." 
                  Every shipment of Paragon implants includes a warning against possible 
                  causes of occlusal overloading, such as adverse crown-to-implant ratio, 
                  excessive cantilevers, an insufficient number of implants to support 
                  the restoration, bruxism, improper occlusal interferences, use of non-Paragon 
                  abutments (e.g. custom cast from plastic patterns), splinting implants 
                  to mobile natural teeth, non-passive frameworks, etc. It is impossible 
                  for any implant manufacturer to be assured that one or more of these 
                  factors have not contributed to or directly caused the fracture. All 
                  a responsible manufacturer can do is try to minimize the potential for 
                  fracture by selecting the strongest available materials and by incorporating 
                  all possible safeguards within the design of the implant (e.g. widening 
                  the neck of the 3.3mmD Screw-Vent). </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In cases where there is limited 
                  available bone and the dentist chooses not to graft the site to allow 
                  placement of a wider diameter implant, a small-diameter implant with 
                  an increased risk of fracture may be the only alternative. To this end, 
                  by Paragon uses only titanium alloy with a minimum tensile strength 
                  that exceeds 150 ksi. In contrast, many other implant manufacturers 
                  (e.g. Lifecore, 3i, Nobel Biocare) use Grade 3 CP Ti, which has a minimum 
                  tensile strength of 65 ksi.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The design of the one-stage 
                  Complete™ Implant introduced by Paragon in 1997 allowed placement of 
                  the internal hex within the wider supracrestal portion of the implant. 
                  This added considerable strength to the small diameter, 3.3mmD implant 
                  at the crest of the ridge. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1999, Paragon replaced 
                  this design with the AdVent™ Implant, which features a tapered body 
                  that is inserted into a socket prepared with a straight drill. In the 
                  narrow ridge, the implant receptor site for a 3.7mmD implant can be 
                  prepared with what would normally be the final-sizing drill for a 3.25 
                  implant. The ridge is then slowly expanded by screwing in the 
                  tapered 3.7mmD implant. This patented method of insertion, now also 
                  available with the Tapered Screw-Vent, enhances initial stability through 
                  increased surface contact. The use of a wider diameter implant also 
                  provides greater strength for the restoration. </font></p>

                  Paragon. However, through the years I inherited four cases where the 
                  implants were "flowering." I have attributed this to the weaker metal, 
                  pure titanium, and 
                  the friction of the tapered internal hex. Also the thickness of the 
                  metal at the base of the hex is extremely thin. What can I do about 
                  these cases, other than core the implant out, and will the company stand 
                  behind their product by reimbursing us for the poor design?</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The dilemma facing both clinicians 
                  and implant manufacturers is how to make an implant small enough in 
                  diameter to be useful in narrow ridges, yet strong enough to withstand 
                  not only normal occlusal loads, but also the type of overloading that 
                  inevitably occurs in clinical use. Paragon does stand behind fractured 
                  implants by replacing them with new implants. We cannot stand behind 
                  the treatment plans or restorations of our customers, however, since 
                  there are so many variables that can cause fractures. Considering the 
                  small number of fractures among the huge number of our internal hex 
                  implants placed since we first introduced them in 1986, as well as the 
                  strength of our products on static and cyclic load tests, an implant 
                  fracture after 5-7 years of function does not mean that the implant 
                  was defective. </font></p>

                  an implant company will "reimburse us and stand behind their product" 
                  is a good one. So far, all I get is the standard replacement policy 
                  where they will give us a new implant for each one that fails within 
                  10 years. I find this to be a bit short, because I also believe there 
                  is a design problem. The new implant is only a fraction of the cost 
                  of dealing with these cases. I have been told by the company that this 
                  is a minor problem. Have any of you also encountered this difficult

                  in a heavy bruxer." Perhaps the tooth has become more mobile over the 
                  years, which would shift more of the load to the implant. Perhaps the 
                  overdenture settled and was not relined, which put torque on the anterior 
                  implants. Perhaps the bar was not a passive fit to begin with, or possibly 
                  a solder joint or fixation screw fractured, transferring load to the

                  A prominent NY periodontist/prosthodontist is currently being sued for 
                  failure to provide the patient with proper informed consent after six 
                  Branemark<sup>&reg;</sup> implants fractured 
                  in one lady. He is accused of failing to advise the patient that other 
                  systems offer stronger materials. Nobel Biocare is included in the suit 
                  for misinforming dental 
                  professionals about the advantages of using Grade 1 commercially pure 
                  titanium. External 
                  hex implants have a well documented history of screw loosening and implant 
                  fractures from overloading. Wider implants, gold fixation screws and use of torque wrenches 
                  have reduced these problems. Straumann had to recall a number of abutments 
                  and pay for retreatment of patients after a series of abutments broke 
                  in a way that was not retrievable. Technological advancements and demands 
                  of the marketplace are making products more reliable. The continuing 
                  challenge is to create a connection so stable that 
                  all occlusal forces are transmitted to the implant, rather than to the 
                  screw. This must be achieved without overloading the implant itself, 
                  especially if small-diameter implants are used. I am convinced Paragon 
                  has come closer to this ideal than any other system today. However, 
                  there is no substitute for good treatment planning and properly designed 
                  restorations. </font></p>

                  an implant design includes an external bevel and an abutment that fits

                  together?</font></p>

                  </font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In essence, 
                  that is what Paragon's new SwissPlus™ ; and Advent™ ; implants feature. 
                  The beveled shoulders of the ITI<sup>&reg;</sup> and SwissPlus implants 
                  work the same way as the internal bevel of the Screw-Vent to provide 
                  stability against lateral forces. ITI, SwissPlus and Advent platforms 
                  are 4.8mm in diameter. At this dimension, the width of the implant platform 
                  provides superior strength. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The beauty of the Tapered 
                  Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup>'s internal bevel is that so much strength 
                  can be achieved in such a small platform (3.7mmD). Where this small 
                  platform is needed, such as between natural teeth and in narrow ridges, 
                  the strength is more than adequate, if the prosthetic design is reasonable. 
                  Under compressive load-to-failure at 30 degrees, the new 3.7mmD Tapered 
                  Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> will fracture at 378 lbs, and fracture will 
                  occur in the internal hex. The 3.7mmD Advent, with the same body but 
                  with a 4.8mmD platform, will fracture at approximately 10% greater force, 
                  with fracture occurring through the body of the implant. External hex 
                  implants made of grade 3 CP Ti fracture below 300 lbs, which occurs 
                  through the body of the implant. If a smaller diameter implant is needed 
                  for support of a lower, freestanding molar in this high-risk area, consideration 
                  should be given to splitting the ridge and widening it so that a wider 
                  implant body, such as the 4.7mmD Screw-Vent or Advent, can be used. 
                  Where a 3.7mmD body is absolutely required for a molar area, the Advent 
                  is the ideal design, because it provides the narrow diameter implant 
                  (without the walls having to be thin near the crest to accommodate the 
                  internal hex), but with a 4.8mm platform in the tissue where there is 
                  no restriction on the diameter. But remember, all that you are getting 
                  is 10% more strength before fracture. </font></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Advent has both an internal 
                  and external bevel. If a narrow abutment is needed, it will follow the 
                  line of the external bevel so that the margin of the restoration can 
                  actually end on the implant, covering the junction. If a wide abutment 
                  is needed, it overlaps the outside bevel to allow for a wider emergence 
                  profile, and then encompasses the top of the implant. Yes, this would 
                  provide greater strength to the implant's hex. With smaller diameter 
                  Advent implants, the fracture occurs in the body, not the hex. The 4.7mmD 
                  Advent is ideal for lower single molar replacement, especially when 
                  used with the wider abutment that overlaps the outer bevel of the platform.

                  a Bar Overdenture restoration on Paragon internal hex implants. For 
                  this case, the Tapered Abutments are recommended, which have a product 
                  code of &quot;ACT.&quot; Tapered Abutments are selected according to 
                  tissue height and the specific implant platform (i.e. diameter of internal 
                  hex platform, in this case). However, all of the components provide 
                  a common abutment top, regardless of the underlying implant type, and 
                  utilize the same series of transfers and laboratory components.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">anchors the collar 
                  to the implant. The tapered screw also receives the fixation screw that 
                  holds the bar in place. As an alternative, this abutment configuration 
                  is also available in a one-piece design for simplicity. However, the 
                  two-piece design provides Paragon’s patented friction-fit connection 
                  for maximum stability and is covered by a 5-Year Guarantee of No Loose 
                  Screws! Inside the head of the tapered screw and below its internal 
                  threads is a 1.25mmD hex used for carrying and inserting the abutment. 
                  30 Ncm of torque is required to fully seat the two-piece abutments.

                  without contacting the top of the tapered screw. The tapered top design 
                  allows for a larger diameter fixation screw than with the Branemark&#210; 
                  Standard Abutment. This enables splinting between the abutment platforms
