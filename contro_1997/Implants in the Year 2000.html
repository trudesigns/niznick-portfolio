                  Somebody said awhile ago something about implant surfaces and tissue 
                  responses. Basically the comment was, "rough is good for bone but bad 
                  for soft tissues." Smooth is good for soft tissues but bad for bone. 
                  I've seen that this may be true. Can somebody provide a physiological 
                  explanation for that?</font></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  When hard tissue grows into the irregularities of a rough surface, it 
                  provides greater attachment strength, as measured by torque tests. This 
                  may also be attributed to the greater surface area created by the rough 
                  surface. Greater attachment strength means a greater ability of the 
                  implant to carry load and withstand micro-movements during initial healing 
                  that could interfere with osseointegration. A rough surface also provides 
                  greater attachment area for soft tissue, which improves attachment. 
                  Since the soft tissue is exposed to the oral environment through the 
                  gingival sulcus, the rough surface can contribute to plaque accumulation. 
                  This could cause soft tissue inflammation that is deleterious to the 
                  attachment and healing of the soft tissue. A smooth surface encourages 
                  undesirable bone loss. Since we can not predict exactly how much the 
                  bone will recede, we cannot know what portion of the implant will be 
                  exposed to either the soft or hard tissue. This is why Paragon created 
                  Dual Transition Selective Surface with a smooth 1 mm collar, a 2 mm 
                  medium-rough (SBM) blasted zone (good for hard or soft tissue) and below 
                  this, HA or TPS. We also have implants with SBM surface only that provide 
                  greater bone attachment than a machined or acid-etched surface. SBM 
                  will not be a problem if it becomes exposed to the soft tissue and it 
                  provides more surface area for soft and hard tissue attachment.</font></p>

                  When HA is exposed to soft tissue, the results can be catastrophic failure, 
                  at least on the dental level. When other relatively rough surfaces become 
                  exposed to soft tissue, we really do not know what problems, if any, 
                  we will have...Wouldn’t you agree that the part about rough surfaces 
                  being good for bone adaptation and smooth surfaces being poor is bunk? 
                  </font></p>

                  I suggest that this doctor read the literature before dismissing as 
                  "bunk" facts that are well documented, such as rougher surfaces increasing 
                  bone attachment (Wennerberg, Buser, Bowers, Block, etc.). As for HA 
                  being disastrous if exposed, I suggest that he read the VA Study results 
                  published in JOMS (1998;56:1302–1311) documenting a 97% success with 
                  1700 HA coated implants with 3-5 year follow-up. All of these Paragon 
                  implants had the HA exposed because they were older designs that only 
                  had a 0.5 mm metal collar, and the average bone loss was over 1.5 mm. 
                  Only 4% of these implants had soft tissue complications compared to 
                  2% for non-coated implants. This doctor further stated: "The manufacturers 
                  think they have all of the answers, but they are just trying to sell 
                  their products...What is the point of manufacturers doing research if 
                  people like this doctor are not influenced by facts?</font></p>

                  You have to separate here what the research is really saying at this

                  apples and oranges?</font></p>

                  I have to agree with this one. Straumann switched from TPS to SLA and 
                  are claiming earlier loading. In fact, the animal studies they cite, 
                  Cochran and Buser, do not show any significant difference in osseointegration 
                  between the two surfaces. Straumann changed to the SLA surface to avoid 
                  the rough TPS becoming exposed and causing soft tissue problems, since 
                  they extended the TPS to the crest of the ridge. Straumann couldn't 
                  admit this was a mistake, so they switched to a blasted/etched surface 
                  without interconnecting pores of TPS and used the excuse of faster healing 
                  to justify the change. 3i just used the acid etching process, which 
                  actually makes the machined surface smoother, and then cites a number 
                  of studies of rough, blasted surfaces to justify their claims of increased 
                  bone attachment. Now they claim earlier loading, which they attribute 
                  to their Osseotite surface without any comparison studies of machined 
                  surfaces side-by-side to support this claim. </font></p>

                  I am slowly getting to use as many different implants as I can to satisfy 
                  my own curiosity as to what is out there. <br>My experience to date is that 
                  they all work and that they work equally well. Can anyone explain why?</font></p>

                  While that may be true in the hands of an experienced clinician in good 
                  quality bone, the VA study shows definite differences between acid-etched 
                  and HA-coated implants, with implants of the same design placed side-by-side 
                  in the same patient. SO, THEY DO NOT ALL WORK THE SAME! For example, 
                  in the maxillary edentulous jaw, HA Screw-Vents had a 94%, 3- to 5-year 
                  survival rate compared to only 72% for acid-etched Screw-Vents. HA coated 
                  press-fit implants in the maxillary posterior had a 97% success rate 
                  after 3-5 years, while Br&aring;nemark’s machined implants had only 
                  87% in the maxilla, according to an article by Friberg.</font></p>

                  As far as the development process of the implants, you must still understand 
                  that, while innovation is great, one of the most compelling critiques 
                  of the Core-Vent/Dentsply/ Paragon systems is that they have changed 
                  and changed and changed. Dentists do not want so much change so fast, 
                  even if the innovations are great! For instance, what are you going 
                  to tell those dentists who invested in the now-obsolete COMPLETE IMPLANT 
                  parts and components? The other companies have not changed so many parts 
                  and pieces so rapidly that they obsolete their product line or make 
                  them so cumbersome that they appear confusing to many dentists. And 
                  what was wrong with the healing collar packaging? It had so many parts 
                  it confused many, but it was and is still an excellent way to deliver 
                  either one- or <br>two-stage implants. I guess you will always be able to 
                  justify everything you do.</font></p>

                  Thanks for taking the time to direct my focus on the rationale behind 
                  my marketing and product design strategy. <br>I know it may not look like 
                  there is a method to my madness. If it were easy to develop a product 
                  line, make sure it remains current with the changing times and successfully 
                  run an implant business, I guess more dentists and entrepreneurs would 
                  be doing it. Certainly some companies like ITI and Nobel Biocare have 
                  been more successful than I have been by focusing on professional endorsements 
                  and creating a specific culture. 3i has done it through buying opinion 
                  leaders and through misinformation. Neither of these companies is in 
                  a good place as far as their product lines go, with no patent protection, 
                  and now by infringing my patents. 3i can only go so far with its phony 
                  claims on its surface. I think, long-term, the best product will win 
                  out — at least that is where I have to be for my own peace of mind and 
                  professional pride.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am reading a book entitled, 
                  The Discipline of Market Leaders. Its thesis is that there are three 
                  types of business strategies:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Customer intimacy - cultivate 
                  relationships through customer service (e.g. Nobel Biocare)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Low prices - (e.g. Lifecore 
                  — started with low prices, but now has a high list price while making 
                  whatever deals it takes to get the sales)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Product leadership: "an 
                  offer of the best products, period. Moreover, product leaders don't 
                  build their positions with just one innovation; they continue to innovate 
                  year after year, product cycle after product cycle." (i.e. Paragon)</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book also states that 
                  a "company must first decide where it will stake its claim in the marketplace 
                  and what kind of value it will offer its customers. Then it can identify 
                  core competencies and reengineer the processes that make up the operating 
                  model required to get the job done."</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As far as customer intimacy 
                  is concerned, it takes too much money and time to stroke the opinion 
                  leaders. Many are looking for the prestige that comes with being a spokesperson 
                  for a large foreign company, and the money they offer in exchange for 
                  their expressed "opinions" that make up for their products’ shortcomings. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paragon is focusing on offering 
                  the best customer service through investing in knowledgeable staff, 
                  state-of-the-art on-line ordering, good manuals and organized, simplified 
                  products. At $121-$143 an implant with many additional product advantages, 
                  the Taper-Lock implant allows me to maintain a premium-priced product 
                  line without having to negotiate discounts as other companies do. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am clearly the market leader 
                  in product innovation because I am not afraid to obsolete my own products, 
                  rather than wait for the competition to do so. Paragon's "core competencies" 
                  include state-of-the-art manufacturing, engineering and an understanding 
                  of how design impacts performance. No other company has a single owner 
                  that is knowledgeable in material sciences, clinical dentistry and has 
                  the total authority to redirect the manufacturing resources as changes 
                  in technology or industry demands dictate. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A perfect example of this 
                  is Paragon's response to the introduction of the double lead, tapered 
                  Mk IV implant from Nobel Biocare. Once they articulated the advantages 
                  of this implant, thereby creating a market for it, I jumped in and did 
                  an end-run around them with triple lead threads on a tapered implant 
                  for insertion into a straight hole. Both of these features where already 
                  covered by Paragon patents and Nobel Biocare has been put on notice 
                  of infringement. Furthermore, I then combined the advantages of both 
                  the Healing Collar Packaging and the Complete Implant by inventing an 
                  Implant Extender, packaged with the AdVent implant. Its large internal 
                  hex will better compete with the ITI implant that requires two neck 
                  lengths and five different heights of cap screws to do what the one 
                  prepackaged AdVent implant can do. The added advantage of the AdVent 
                  is that it will allow Paragon to eliminate more than twice as many parts 
                  as it adds, which will reduce backorder problems, as well as our manufacturing 
                  costs. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the Complete System 
                  being obsolete, all the same drills and tools work with the AdVent implant. 
                  A new, stronger hex tool will be made, but the one for the Complete 
                  Implant and Healing Collar Packaging works. The AdVent offers many advantages 
                  that warrant the change. The Complete Implant, while interesting enough 
                  to open some doors and get some interest, did not light the fire I thought 
                  it would. Furthermore, its applications were limited to the non-esthetic 
                  zone and a one-stage protocol. The Healing Collar System was good but 
                  not much better than attaching a healing collar at time of placement. 
                  With the one-piece healing collars, the restorative dentists could detach 
                  them without special tools. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The industry is moving towards 
                  one-stage surgery. The AdVent once again says to the profession that 
                  Paragon continues to take a leadership role in innovation and to that 
                  extent, reaffirms our position as the industry leader in innovation. 
                  </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the vast majority of "late 
                  adopters" still stuck on Nobel Biocare or other external hex implants, 
                  hopefully the pricing and features of the Taper-Lock will get them interested. 
                  Our CD-ROM program attempts to educate dentists to be more discerning 
                  and aware that not all systems are equal. The fact that Paragon is the 
                  only company providing this competitive information should say to dentists 
                  that we understand their concerns, we have the answers and we are not 
                  afraid to compare our products to those of the competitors. Our case 
                  registration program gives the surgeon an easy way to provide the information 
                  my staff needs to contact the restorative dentists and guide them through 
                  the abutment selection process. This one-on-one level of customer service, 
                  unprecedented in the industry, eliminates the need for my salespeople 
                  to run around holding the hand of every GP. The Paradigm Shift concept 
                  also eliminates the need of the referring dentist to know what implant 
                  the surgeon used prior to selecting/attaching abutments. If the surgeon 
                  attaches the abutments, there are no new parts or procedures for the 
                  referring dentists to be concerned about with our system. Surgeons no 
                  longer have to spend time hand-holding their restorative dentists—Paragon 
                  will do it for them with the case registration program.<br>

                  Please explain the difference between the AdVent and the Complete implants. 
                  I noted that the AdVent requires different drills than the Complete. 
                  Please explain the various drills. Also, the abutment connection platform 
                  for the AdVent appears to be different from the Micro-Vent. Does that 
                  mean that the AdVent is a totally different implant and, consequently, 
                  requires different surgical and prosthetic armamentaria?</font></p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  I began development of the one-stage implant in 1993. My first effort 
                  was a two-piece, two-stage, Screw-Vent implant with Healing Collar Packaging 
                  rather than Fixture Mount/Transfer Packaging. The 4mmL healing collar 
                  was internally hexed and designed for easy implant insertion. After 
                  osseointegration, the healing collar could be converted into an abutment 
                  by attaching a ball or tapered abutment screw. The healing collar could 
                  also be removed and replaced with a standard preparable abutment for 
                  esthetic, subgingival margins.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1997, I introduced the 
                  Complete implant, adding 3.5 mm to the top of the implant and duplicating 
                  the platform of the standard Br&aring;nemark abutment. The idea was 
                  that in areas where esthetics did not demand the ability to remove the 
                  collar, why not make it a permanent part of the implant to serve as 
                  an abutment? The shortcoming of this implant was that, in duplicating 
                  the Br&aring;nemark abutment platform, I had to use a small fixation 
                  screw. I prefer over-engineering a system, so I was looking for a better 
                  way to accomplish my objectives.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1999, I introduced the 
                  AdVent, which combines the best features of the two-piece, two-stage, 
                  implant with Healing Collar Packaging and the Complete implant into 
                  one design. The AdVent has a 3mmL extended collar with a 1mmL tapered 
                  top, allowing the margin of the restoration can be further extended 
                  below the soft tissue. The AdVent platform has a large, 3mmD internal 
                  hex with a lead-in bevel. Although the wide Micro-Vent implant also 
                  has a 3mmD internal hex, its platform is different from the AdVent’s. 
                  This internal hex allows attachment of a much stronger screw than was 
                  possible with the Complete implant. Furthermore, the AdVent’s platform 
                  was designed so that a ZAAG female titanium housing can be screwed in, 
                  providing a low-profile overdenture attachment. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Complete implant’s cover 
                  screw added another 1.5mm to its 3.5mm attached collar. The AdVent implant, 
                  with its internal hex, uses a low profile cover screw that adds nothing 
                  to its overall height. The AdVent’s low profile cover screw allows the 
                  implant to be countersunk 2mm for a two-stage surgical protocol, if 
                  that is what is desired. The AdVent is also packaged with a 2mmL Implant 
                  Extender that can be placed at the time of stage-one surgery. Once the 
                  implant extender has been attached, it projects up though the tissue 
                  to allow for a one-stage surgical protocol. This works like the one-stage 
                  protocol of Healing Collar Packaging, but with an esthetic, subgingival 
                  margin to the restoration. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another advantage of the 
                  AdVent implant over the Complete implant is its tapered body. Designed 
                  for insertion into a straight and slightly undersized osteotomy, its 
                  tapered body provides increased stability in soft bone through bone 
                  compression. This unique feature also allows for the elimination of 
                  a narrow 3.3mmD implant, which leaves only the 3.7 and 4.7mmD implants 
                  — both with the same 4.1mmD platform. The AdVent implant also features 
                  triple lead threads for faster insertion. Despite their differences, 
                  however, both the Complete and AdVent implants require the same drills 
                  and insertion tools.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In January 2000, Paragon 
                  will introduce the new Tapered Screw-Vent two-stage implant with triple 
                  lead threads, just like the AdVent implant. It will be available in 
                  3.7mmD, 4.7mmD and 6.0mmD with the same three available platforms as 
                  the current Micro-Vent2 implant. Its tapered body eliminates the need 
                  for a 3.3mmD Tapered Screw-Vent, since the 3.7mmD Tapered Screw-Vent 
                  can be inserted into a socket prepared in a narrow ridge for a 3.3mmD 
                  implant by expanding the bone as it’s diameter widens from 2.7mmD to 
                  3.7mmD during the insertion process. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The new Tapered Screw-Vent, 
                  like the AdVent, will feature Paragon’s patented dual transition surfacing. 
                  The HA-coated implant includes a 2mm blasted (SBM) zone at the crest 
                  of the ridge. The Tapered Screw-Vent will also be available with just 
                  the SBM surface. New step-down drills will be available for inserting 
                  the implant into dense bone, assuring bone engagement by the narrow 
                  apical threads during final seating. When drilling in soft bone, surgical 
                  protocol requires the preparation of an undersized osteotomy. This is 
                  achieved by simply using what has traditionally been the intermediate 
                  drill (2.8mm for 3.7mmD implant; 3.8mm for 4.7mmD implant) as the final 
                  drill. Ideal for use in soft bone and narrow ridges, good bone contact 
                  is achieved throughout the length of the tapered implant, even when 
                  inserted into a socket prepared with a straight drill. This can also 
                  be accomplished with the current straight drills by penetrating to the 
                  score line that corresponds with the implant length with the intermediate 
                  drill, then stopping one score line shorter with the final drill to 
                  create a stepped-down osteotomy.</font></p>

                  On rare occasions, new technology will provide a wake-up call to an 
                  entire industry. The need to achieve immediate fixation in soft bone, 
                  the dilemma of inserting an implant into narrow ridges, components that 
                  provide adequate strength, and the solution to repeated screw loosening 
                  have long challenged implant manufacturers. The desire for simplified 
                  surgical protocols, including self-tapping insertion and a one-stage 
                  surgical protocol that provides the esthetics of a two-stage implant, 
                  can be added to these clinical requirements. For implant dentistry to 
                  be a viable alternative to conventional dentistry, implant systems must 
                  provide versatile prosthetic applications with a minimum of components, 
                  complexity and cost. Paragon's AdVent and Tapered Screw-Vent implants 
                  provide viable solutions to these needs, and thus herald a new era in 
                  dental implant technology and innovation. </font></p>

                    as depicted in the tri-colored AdVent implant used in our advertisements. 
                    This patented new triple lead thread pattern enables the implant to 
                    seat three times faster than screw-type implants with the traditional 
                    single-thread pattern. Triple lead threads also reduce torque in dense 
                    bone by 12% (Study: Taper-Lock™ ; implant with triple lead threads 
                    vs. single-thread Branemark clone implant), which lessens surgical

                  implant. When esthetics is not a primary concern, a one-stage protocol 
                  eliminates the uncovering surgery and shortens treatment time. Corresponding 
                  surgical trauma is greatly reduced, which can make implant therapy more
