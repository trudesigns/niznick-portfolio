                  Paragon recently licensed Friadent to use our internal hex patent. So 
                  I can't say anything negative about the connection. I would suggest 
                  that you look at the abutments, though. They have shoulders on them, 
                  which come in different cuff heights. This adds to the selection process 
                  and prevents attachment of the abutment in place of a healing collar 
                  to hold the tissue back without also making a provisional prosthesis. 
                  Friadent's angled abutment has the shoulder high on the labial and low 
                  on the lingual, the exact opposite of what a natural preparation would 
                  be. This means that excessive grinding is needed on the labial and the 
                  lingual margin is too far below the tissue to allow attachment directly 
                  in the mouth for conventional impressions. All preparation needs to 
                  be on the stone case. Check out the following link showing this abutment:<br>
                  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323015726/http://www.implantdirect.com/research/controversy/contro1_pt02-3b.html" target="_blank">../research/controversy/contro1_pt02-3b.html</a> 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Paragon only sells full-contour, preparable abutments, which eliminate 
                  the need to inventory abutments with different shoulder heights. Furthermore, 
                  Friadent abutments do not come in varying diameters so that emergence 
                  profile cannot be controlled in the abutment preparation. Compare the 
                  prices of Friadent's angled abutments to those of Paragon. Check out 
                  Paragon's abutment holding tool and Ganz's preparation instruments that 
                  allow chairside preparation of the abutments, followed by conventional 
                  impressions after the abutment is attached. It saves money and time:<br>

                  As for the implants, Friadent is a step-design implant with minimum 
                  depth threads only in the step sections and not along the entire length 
                  of the implant, as with the Tapered Screw-Vent one-stage and AdVent 
                  two-stage implants. The Tapered SwissPlus also offers much deeper threads 
                  near the top for more thread engagement. In addition, Paragon implants 
                  include a fixture mount that is also the transfer and temporary abutment 
                  (permanent abutment with the SwissPlus line). Check out picture #4 on 
                  Newsletter 7 for a side-by-side comparison:<br>
                  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323015726/http://www.implantdirect.com/newsletter7/index.html" target="_blank">../newsletter7/index.html</a><br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, each length of the Friadent implant requires a different drill 
                  length and you must fully seat the Friadent implant to the depth of 
                  its preparation. With the drill and the implant matching in steps, there 
                  is no ability for bone expansion in soft bone. Tapered implants from 
                  Paragon are inserted using a single straight drill for all four lengths 
                  of a particular diameter implant. If the surgical sight has been prepared 
                  too deep, the surgeon can stop where he wants the top of the implant 
                  to be in relationship with the crest without compromising initial stability.<br>
                  <br>
                  Oh...did I say that Friadent now has a good connection? Well, it could 
                  be improved. It still has a shoulder versus a bevel like the internal 
                  bevel on the Screw-Vent and AdVent and the external bevel on the SwissPlus 
                  and ITI. Remember, the internal hex is only half of the connection. 
                  Only Paragon offers friction-fit abutments with a 5-year guarantee that 
                  the abutment fixation screw will not to come loose. Paragon's friction-fit 
                  transfers will provide the most accurate working cast possible.<br>
                  <br>
                  I know that I forgot something...what about the surface? Friadent does 
                  not have Paragon's Dual Transition Selective Surface. IF THAT IS NOT 
                  ENOUGH, WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT FRIADENT IS NOT A ONE-STAGE IMPLANT 
                  like the ITI, AdVent and SwissPlus?<br>
                  <br>
                  I think that the internal connection feature of the Friadent is certainly 
                  an improvement over the external hexes or the non-indexed connections 
                  of Bicon and the old ITI, but is it "fantastic.". If you are looking 
                  for a "fantastic" implant, you only need look as far as Paragon Implant 
                  Company.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b><font size="5">Friadent User:</font></b> I can agree with you that 
                  the angled abutments should be changed. The shoulder heights should 
                  be different. This is a good point. I have yet to use an angled abutment 
                  since the taper on the implant allows for me to place the implant exactly 
                  at the long axis of the extraction socket.<br>

                  <font size="5"><b>Dr. Niznick:</b></font> When placing an implant into 
                  an extraction socket in the maxillary anterior or, for that matter, 
                  into an area that has been edentulous for some time, optimum positioning 
                  to take advantage of the greatest length of bone is usually to slant 
                  the implant to the lingual. If you follow the socket and try to use 
                  a longer implant, you will perforate through the labial. A tooth can 
                  exist with a thin labial plate but an implant cannot, so it is generally 
                  accepted to angle the implant to bisect the buccal and lingual plates 
                  and correct the angle with an angled abutment. You are being forced 
                  into a less than ideal positioning of the Friadent implant to avoid 
                  a poorly designed (and overpriced) angled abutment from Friadent. THAT 
                  IS NOT MY IDEA OF FANTASTIC!<br>

                  <font size="5"><b>Dr. Niznick:</b></font> MY IDEA OF A FANTASTIC SYSTEM 
                  is one that meets all clinical needs so that you do not need to use 
                  two other systems. Paragon's Tapered SwissPlus offers the taper of a 
                  Friadent, even more thread engagement and improved self-tapping features 
                  of a Lifecore and the one-stage surgical protocol of an ITI. If you 
                  are using Lifecore for its low price and/or external hex, then Paragon's 
                  Taper-Lock offers price, prosthetic, design and surface advantages over 
                  Lifecore. If you are using Friadent for two-stage surgery because of 
                  its tapered design and internal connection, then Paragon's Tapered Screw-Vent 
                  offers thread engagement, surface, abutment stability and prosthetic 
                  advantages over Friadent, as well as a fixture mount that also serves 
                  as the transfer and temporary abutment. If you are using ITI for one-stage 
                  implants, then the straight SwissPlus offers a self-tapping option that 
                  is about half the cost, because it includes the transfer and the abutment.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font size="5"><b>Friadent User:</b></font> The advantages of immediate 
                  placement are: (1) Only one surgery is required. (2) The patient has 
                  no functional and psychological discomfort associated with being edentulous. 
                  (3) Vital bone height is maintained. (4) There is no stripping of the 
                  periosteum from the bone tissue. Since the periosteum provides 80% of 
                  the blood supply to alveolar bone, this avoids possible resorption due 
                  to the interruption of the blood supply. (5) There is no blunting of 
                  the interproximal tissue during the healing phase leading to reconstruction 
                  of the delicate papillary tissue. (6) The patient does not have to wear 
                  an uncomfortable, removable provisional prosthesis. (7) Better tissue 
                  esthetics can be obtained. (8) Studies demonstrate higher bone-to-implant 
                  ratios.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font size="5"><b>Dr. Niznick:</b></font> I agree with you regarding 
                  the advantages of immediate placement, but there is nothing unique about 
                  the Friadent implant that makes it especially suited for this procedure. 
                  I popularized immediate replacement with the Core-Vent implant in the 
                  1980s through my two-day surgical courses and several thousand lectures 
                  around the world. One case that I did at a live surgical course attended 
                  by the head of OS from UCLA involved removal of about 20 teeth, placement 
                  of 8 implants in the maxilla and 6 in the mandible, followed by delivery 
                  of immediate dentures...all osseointegrated except for one maxillary 
                  cuspid implant.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font size="5"><b>Friadent User:</b></font> It is my opinion that the 
                  Frialit Ć 2 is the standard implant to be used for immediate placement 
                  of an implant after extraction. The tapered-step feature was designed 
                  with immediate placement in mind. The step feature allows for a positive 
                  seat of the implant within the socket. This helps offset occlusal loads 
                  and transfers the load to a compressive force, which is most favorable 
                  to bone (Misch 1992). The three screws per step help lock this implant 
                  into the socket and decrease the micromovement. The tapered design is 
                  shaped as the tooth root that makes for easier placement along the long 
                  axis of the tooth. This creates a more favorable load on the implant 
                  and helps avoid the need for angled abutments.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font size="5"><b>Dr. Niznick:</b></font> One does not need a tapered 
                  implant to do immediate placement. In fact, repreparing the socket with 
                  parallel walls so that the implant can engage freshly cut bone, and 
                  especially bone apical to the socket, will add to initial stability. 
                  In the maxillary anterior area, one would not be well advised to follow 
                  the socket because of the thinness of the labial plate and the abundance 
                  of good bone to the apical and lingual of the socket in what Scott Ganz 
                  calls the Triangle of Bone. Check out this article on Ganz's website

                  <br>
                  The problem with the steps in the Friadent implant is that the implant 
                  lacks stability unless it is fully seated. A straight or tapered implant 
                  with threads over the entire length will still be stable if the socket 
                  were prepared deeper than the dentist ultimately places the implant. 
                  The dentist needs the latitude to decide on final seating of the implant 
                  if the implant should be seated to the full depth of the socket preparation 
                  or left slightly higher. Sometimes the socket is inadvertently placed 
                  deeper than the implant needs to be to have it flush with the crest 
                  of the ridge. A fully threaded implant provides more thread engagement 
                  than the 3 shallow threads per step section of the Friadent implant.<br>
                  <br>
                  I disagree that the narrow ledges of a Friadent implant is what Dr. 
                  Misch had in mind...he advocates deeper threads for more load carrying 
                  ability than the shallow ones on a Friadent. The ledges of the Friadent 
                  implant are even shallower than the threads of that implant, so they 
                  contribute little to increasing load bearing surface. The new Friadent 
                  Syncrostep implant adds a few threads to the neck portion of the implant, 
                  but these threads are even more shallow than the threads on the body.<br>
                  <br>
                  On the other hand, the 4.8mmD Tapered SwissPlus provides threads in 
                  the coronal aspect of the implant that are twice as deep as the Friadent 
                  or Branemark, Steri-Oss, 3i or ITI implants, providing optimum surface 
                  to withstand compressive load. The Paragon surgical protocol of placing 
                  a tapered implant into a straight hole for bone expansion/compression 
                  will provide much more stability in soft bone than the Friadent or any 
                  of these other implant systems. In fact, in soft bone, the Tapered SwissPlus 
                  is inserted into an undersized socket so that the entire depth of the 
                  0.6mm deep threads engage bone upon insertion. When considering the 
                  importance of initial stability, it should also be noted that the Friadent 
                  implant is not self-tapping in dense bone as it has no apical grooves 
                  or threads.<br>
                  <br>
                  <font size="5"><b>Friadent User:</b></font> The taper allows for a wider 
                  implant to be used coronal in the socket, which obliterates the extraction 
                  site with the implant. This creates a faster integration time and a 
                  more favorable natural emergence profile. The wider the implant the 
                  better support for the hard and soft tissues at the critical coronal 
                  area. All of these features lead to a very esthetic and successful single 
                  tooth implant restoration.<br>
                  <b><font size="5"><br>
                  Dr. Niznick:</font></b> Several articles and a number of clinicians 
                  have reported higher failure rates and more bone loss with wide implants 
                  (wider than 5mmD). The VA started a study funded by 3i using their wide 
                  diameter implants and, when the results started to document greater 
                  failures and bone loss, 3i stopped the funding. An article in the Journal 
                  of Periodontology reported on 100 consecutively placed 3.7mmD Screw-Vent 
                  implants inserted into extraction sockets with 95% five-year success 
                  and an average of 0.5mm of bone loss. If the space around the neck of 
                  a narrow implant in an extraction socket is filled with bone chips from 
                  the osteotomy, there is a better chance of preserving bone height than 
                  by using a wide diameter implant that fills the socket, leaving thin 
                  cortical plate in contact with the implant.</font> <br>

                  Getting osseointegration to occur while subjecting the implant to some 
                  degree of micro-movement by immediate loading is a complex issue. Several 
                  factors contribute to achieving clinical success when subjecting an 
                  implant to immediate load. These include:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Density of the bone—the

                  implant based on design—the result of self-tapping threads and bone 
                  compression by placing a tapered implant into a straight hole. The AdVent 
                  implant from Paragon offers these features and Paragon has the patent 
                  on this method of insertion. </font></p>

                  compared to 56% for TPS in an immediate load animal study. HA may even 
                  be better because of faster integration. If the implant is overloaded 
                  in the first few weeks,however, faster integration with HA (within 6 
                  weeks) may not be a factor. </font></p>

                  design can be a factor in the implant's ability to distribute load and 
                  minimize micromovements that can interfere with achieving osseointegration. 
                  Self-tapping threads, preferably with more depth between the inside 
                  and outside dimensions than with the standard Branemark V-shaped threads, 
                  could also contribute to increased initial stability and load distribution

                  candidates, bonewise. Have others had similar success stories?</font></p>

                  The periodontist that told me he had about 25 out of 50 failures with 
                  Sargon also told me that after 3-5 years of follow-up, he has developed 
                  a new procedure that he calls pod-ectomy. He cuts off one of the pods 
                  or spread feet of the Sargon in order to treat the trifurcation involvement 
                  that has developed with bone loss. Do you really want to do more than 
                  these original five until you have had a chance to observe at least 
                  3 years follow-up on the ones you have placed? Any solid, screw-type, 
                  self-tapping implant with a rough or HA coating will work just as well 
                  or better for immediate load without the risk of creating a trifurcation 
                  involvement. And let’s not forget the instability of the standard external 
                  hex connection of the Sargon Implant. Do you really think that is the 
                  most stable platform to use for single tooth replacements?</font></p>

                  I placed and engaged the Sargon implant as high as possible, immediately 
                  loaded (completely out of occlusion), and followed the apparent stimulation 
                  of new bone by the implant. This is, of course, anecdotal, but apparent 
                  on X-ray. Some four months later, the final restoration has been placed 
                  following weekly evaluations that indicated no required expansion after 
                  the first visit and no mobility (excellent ping) since placement. Can 
                  any other implant design match this kind of success?</font></p>

                  If you think that this success was do to good initial stability or, 
                  perhaps, initial spreading of the pods (although you don't indicate 
                  this), then an implant like the Advent or the MkIV, which are tapered 
                  but placed into a straight hole for bone expansion, would accomplish 
                  the same thing. Secondary spreading of the pods is a fallback position 
                  if the initial loading causes loss of integration. A study in Belgium 
                  tested four different implant materials in immediate loading: HA, TPS, 
                  Paragon's SBM and a resorbable HA. They all worked, and the SBM-blasted 
                  surface achieved 60% bone contact. You won't get that with a smooth 
                  machined surface like the Sargon or Br&aring;nemark implant. Logic dictates 
                  that a grit-blasted or coated, tapered, self-tapping implant placed 
                  into a straight hole for bone expansion should give you the best chance 
                  for success without the long-term risks of fractures or trifurcation 
                  evolvement from a molly bolt design that must spread to achieve its 
                  initial stability. Because of this molly bold design, the Sargon implant 
                  can't be coated. <br>

                  the Paragon System, but I am still using the Endopore System for situations 
                  where there is poor bone quality. What approach does Paragon use for 
                  soft bone?</font></p>
                <p><font size="6" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  I am pleased that you have started to use the Paragon System. The tapered 
                  Screw-Vent and AdVent implants were specifically designed to gain increased 
                  initial stability in soft bone. This is achieved by inserting these 
                  tapered implants into an undersized socket prepared with a straight 
                  drill. For consistent success in soft bone, initial implant stability 
                  is critical. Self-tapping threads and bone expansion are design features 
                  that will better achieve this than inserting a tapered, non-threaded 
                  implant into a tapered hole like with Innova's Endopore implant. It 
                  just makes sense.<br>
                  <br>
                  Yes, the Endopore System allows for bone ingrowth, but the threads and 
                  blasted surface texture of the Screw-Vent match or exceed the surface 
                  area of the Endopore implant once osseointegration is achieved, which 
                  is the critical first step. If you want to increase bone attachment 
                  strength, use the HA-coated Screw-Vent. With the Screw-Vent, you will 
                  not have to worry about future soft tissue complications that can occur 
                  when the bone resorption exposes the Endopore's beads, making hygiene 
                  next to impossible.<br>
                  <br>
                  I suggest you review the article I recently published in Oral Health, 
                  a Canadian journal, on achieving success in soft bone. Here is a link 
                  to it on our website. <br>
                  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120323015726/http://www.implantdirect.com/research/article.pdf" target="_blank">../research/article.pdf</a><br>
                  <br>
                  Once osseointegration is achieved, and the implant can demonstrate that 
                  it can withstand load, the stability of the prosthetic connection will 
                  determine long-term complications, such as screw loosening. Paragon 
                  guarantees no screw loosening for 5 years. Another major shortcoming 
                  of the Innova's Endopore System is its external hex connection.<br>

                  Biocare has it for type 3–4 bone only, because the hex is too weak for 
                  dense bone. I patented this method of insertion in 1993 and have put

                  #2: Implant-to-bone surface. The most desirable is one with both macro 
                  irregularities for bone ingrowth and micro irregularities for bone attachment. 
                  In addition, a bioactive surface (HA) increases bone attachment strength. 
                  The optimum surface is one that offers these features, but will not 
                  present a soft tissue complication if the rough surfaces become exposed 
                  to soft tissue. The following are the design options in decreasing order 
                  of desirability to meet this objective: </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. A Self-tapping screw starts 
                  out with bone between the macro-irregularities of the threads. Beaded 
                  surfaces, such as the Endopore, or deep, non-self-tapping threads, such 
                  as on the Maestro, require bone to grow into macro-irregularities. If 
                  the screw is blasted or TPS coated, this will increase the micro-irregularities 
                  and increase both percentage and strength of bone attachment. HA coating 
                  also increases micro-irregularities while further enhancing attachment 
                  strength and early healing. If the implant has a blasted transition 
                  zone between the crest of the ridge and the TPS- or HA-coated surface, 
                  the bone recession will stop on the blasted zone and not expose the 
                  HA or TPS. Paragon’s patented Dual Transition Selective Surface on the 
                  Micro-Vent2 and ADVENT implants meet all of these objectives.</font></p>

                  trade-off of using this surface without the transition zone or without 
                  the self-tapping efficiency of Paragon's Selective Surface is worth 
                  its use in order to get increased success in soft bone. It is worth 
                  the risk of soft-tissue complications, if exposed, but the dense HA 
                  now being used by most manufacturers is actually relatively smooth and 
                  should not be a problem, if exposed. The VA study used 1700 HA-coated 
                  Paragon implants that only had a 0.5 mm smooth collar, and reported 
                  no significantly higher soft tissue complications than acid etched implants 
                  at the 3–5 year follow-up.</font></p>

                  (SBM from Paragon, RBM from Lifecore, Maestro), or by blasting with 
                  Al2O3 followed by acid etching to remove the contamination (SLA from 
                  Straumann). These surfaces are not so rough that they will cause soft-tissue 
                  complications if exposed, but do add to the attachment strength of the

                  10u grooves: Although this smooth surface is not really desirable, at 
                  least bone loss does not expose a very rough surface that can cause 
                  soft tissue complications. Core-Vent's implants acid-etched with HF/NO3 
                  used in the VA study produced pits about 10u in size and demonstrated 
                  significantly higher failure rates in Type 1 bone (7% difference), and 
                  even a greater difference in Type 4 bone (20%). The difference in success 
                  was less dramatic in the hands of experienced and skilled surgeons, 
                  but was still significant. After 1997, Paragon replaced this surface 
                  with the blasted SBM surface, which is created by blasting with soluble 
                  tricalcium phosphate.</font></p>

                  is even smoother than a machined surface. It should prove to be even 
                  less successful long-term in porous bone than the standard machined 
                  surface. Sullivan (JPD 1997;78:379–386) reported 36% failure in type 
                  4 bone with this implant (4 out of 11 implants). Lazarra's early loading 
                  studies excluded implants placed in Type 4 bone, although the article 
                  failed to mention it (J Esthetic Dent 1998;10(6):280–289). This was

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">G. Beads that create large 
                  interconnecting pores below a smooth neck: When bone recedes down the 
                  smooth neck (Endopore), as it will inevitably do, the beads are exposed 
                  to the gingival sulcus and can lead to soft-tissue complications. With 
                  rough surfaces like HA or TPS, the surface can be exposed and smoothed 
                  to treat such complications. Beads offer no such opportunity. In the 
                  late 1980s, the University of Toronto group that developed the Endopore 
                  surface reported about 50% failures in dogs due to infections from the 
                  exposed beads. When this implant first came to market, it had a 2 mm 
                  long neck to compensate for the risk of exposure, but this only encouraged 
                  bone recession and exposed the beads anyway. Innova eventually shortened 
                  the neck of the Endopore implant to 1 mm and accepts the fact that the 
                  top of the beaded surface may become exposed. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are no comparative 
                  clinical studies showing that Endopore works any better in a short length 
                  than short HA- or TPS-coated implants. Duke Heller of the Midwest Implant 
                  Institute did the clinical studies to meet anticipated FDA requirements, 
                  and informed me that he had good success with the very short Endopore, 
                  but eventually had failures or complications with about 20%–25% of the 
                  ones that were 12 mm long. I cannot explain why this would be the case, 
                  other than to speculate that the shorter ones were in denser bone not 
                  as susceptible to bone recession that would expose the beads. </font></p>

                  The only connection in the industry that eliminates both tipping and 
                  rotational movements, while still providing indexing for transfers, 
                  is Paragon's patented internal and tapered external hex implants with 
                  friction-fit abutments. Of the two, the internal hex with a lead-in 
                  bevel provides twice the interdigitation surface and better tactile 
                  sense than the standard external hex. This eliminates the need for X-rays 
                  to verify seating. The internal hex, with its lead-in bevel, does not 
                  have the limitations of the external hex with a shoulder that, if placed 
                  subcrestal, can contribute to soft tissue entrapment when seating the 
                  abutment.</font></p>

                  a lead-in bevel for added resistance to tipping forces and prevention 
                  of soft tissue entrapment on abutment seating. Friatec is being sued 
                  by Paragon for patent infringement. </font></p>

                  design (Astra and ITI) eliminate tipping movements. However, both of 
                  these companies recognize the need to have an internal hex or octagon 
                  for transfer capabilities and have recently added this feature. ITI 
                  is being sued by Paragon for patent infringement and Astra has been 
                  put on notice of infringement. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. External hexes: These 
                  connections have a well-documented history of screw loosening. The lack 
                  of tactile sense has resulted in documented incidences of incomplete 
                  seating of transfers and abutments that lead to inaccuracies and costly 
                  remakes. Longer hexes improve tactile sense but increase interference 
                  with esthetics when using angled abutments. Innova has both the 0.7mm 
                  standard and 1mm long external hex connection.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. Spline: This connection 
                  is no better than a 1 mm external hex, but is so weak in the 3.3mmD 
                  implant that Calcitek can't use this connection in their small diameter 
                  screw implant. This necessitates use of different Calcitek implant connections 
                  (3.3mmD external hex and 4.0mmD spline) screw implants in the same jaw, 
                  adding to prosthetic confusion. Because the tapered abutments for the 
                  Spline implant must be made in two pieces, you can not do much preparation 
                  on the bottom 2mm of the abutment. This necessitates countersinking 
                  the implant so that the splines are level with the bone. This, in turn, 
                  necessitates cutting away bone at the time of abutment attachment, as 
                  the wider contour abutments do not match the profile of the cover screw. 
                  Spline, in effect, turns a 2-stage procedure into a 3-stage procedure.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Morse Taper: This design 
                  (Bicon) eliminates tipping and there can be no loose screw problem, 
                  because there are no screws. It is, nevertheless, in my opinion, the 
                  worse connection, because it can and does loosen in some instances. 
                  Furthermore, it does not allow for transfers to indirectly prepare the 
                  abutments. Another shortcoming of the Bicon connection is that it creates 
                  an undercut between the abutment and the implant that requires countersinking 
                  the implant 3–5mm below the crest of the ridge. This is done in order 
                  to get the height of contour of the abutment lower to fabricate a restoration 
                  with a subgingival margin. In addition, this requires countersinking 
                  the crest at the time of implant placement to fully seat the abutment. 
                  It turns a two-stage procedure into a 3-stage procedure.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have covered the three 
                  most important factors in implant design: the body, the surface and 
                  the connection. Innova brings nothing to the party other than an unsubstantiated 
                  theory/marketing story that the relatively smooth beads, with large 
                  pores in between, will somehow enable it to be used in a shorter length 
                  than competing implants. Keller from Mayo published on Br&aring;nemark 
                  implants used in the resorbed edentulous symphysis with only 4–5mm engaging 
                  bone, and had very high long-term success. </font></p>

                  TThe links discussing published research that has been falsely extrapolated 
                  by Implant Innovations, Inc. (3i) should not have given you the impression 
                  that I was saying that "Paragon is the ONLY implant that is any good," 
                  or that it is "the ONLY implant that should be used in dentistry." However, 
                  the links should have made you aware of serious shortcomings in such 
                  areas as surface features and connections that are present in 3i's Osseotite 
                  implant, but which are not present in Paragon implants. As for Dr. Tarnow 
                  having "some pretty good research with the Osseotite Implant," I would 
                  ask you to cite the reference so I can review the article. As for Dr. 
                  Tarnow being wrong, the answer is yes, he is wrong when he says the 
                  Osseotite etched surface increases surface roughness. Acid etching decreases 
                  surface roughness in the important parameters of peak-to-peak and peak-to-valley 
                  dimensions. This was confirmed in a recent article in by Wennerberg 
                  et al. (Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 1993;8[6]:622-633.) He is wrong 
                  in saying that you need a machined neck for the first 3mm (contrary 
                  to ITI, Astra and Paragon implant designs). He is wrong if he claims 
                  that the Osseotite surface enhances clinical success in soft bone. "Enhances 
                  clinical success" as compared to what? That is certainly not the case 
                  when the Osseotite is compared to either a blasted surface or an HA-coated 
                  surface. A recent article in JOMI reported only 79% success in the maxilla 
                  with Osseotite after 1 year (Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 2000;15(3):331). 
                  Dr. Tarnow is wrong if he claims that the Osseotite surface allows earlier 
                  loading. Once again, "earlier loading" as compared to what? Certainly 
                  not earlier than a blasted surface or an HA-coated surface. Other than 
                  showing a higher percentage of bone contact compared to a machined surface 
                  in an animal study, there is no proof of this. He is wrong if he claims 
                  that the Osseotite surface improves bone attachment strength. Buser 
                  et al. published an article showing it was about half the attachment 
                  strength of ITI's SLA surface (Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 1998;13[5]:611-619).<br>

                  THE POINT IS THAT YOU 
                  NEED TO BECOME DISCERNING YOURSELF. DO NOT RELY ON PAID COMPANY SPOKESMEN. 
                  ONCE A COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPOSED IN LYING ABOUT THE STUDIES IT USES TO 
                  SUPPORT ITS PRODUCTS, AS 3i HAS DONE, BE SKEPTICAL OF ANYTHING THAT 
                  COMPANY CLAIMS. <br>
                  <br>
                  As for Paragon being the "the ONLY implant that is any good," the answer 
                  is "NO." It is also not true that Paragon "is the ONLY implant that 
                  should be used in dentistry," but it is true that 3i Osseotite implants 
                  are far down on the list of implants with the most desirable features… 
                  no internal connection, no multiple lead threads, no rough surface, 
                  no fixture mount/transfers, no taper, no trustworthy research. <br>
                  <br>
                  WHAT I AM SAYING IS FOR YOU TO BE DISCERNING. Today, the external hex 
                  connection is on its way out, as Nobel Biocare acknowledges in its ads 
                  for the Steri-Oss Replace Select implant, which states: "What every 
                  dentist wants... an internal connection." Friadent and Straumann have 
                  now taken a license on my internal hex patent. 3i was previously licensed 
                  under my patent, but stopped because of the 30% royalty payments. Lifecore 
                  and Calcitek also were on the short end of patent litigation over my 
                  patent, which lead to the development of their current systems of external 
                  hex and spline implants. ITI last year finally added an internal octagon 
                  to its internal conical connection to make it more usable. Axel Kirsh, 
                  after pushing his IMZ intramobile element for years, now has introduced 
                  an internal three-groove connection (which Steri-Oss copied). Sulzer 
                  just acquired Paragon, primarily because of our loyal customer base, 
                  which has been built on our internal hex implants.<br>
                  <br>
                  SO, THE QUESTION IS: ARE YOU DISCERNING? If you obtain a copy of Paragon's 
                  free, educational CD-ROM and review the section on the 3i implant system's 
                  false and misleading statements, you will become a lot more discerning 
                  than you have so far indicated by your advocacy of 3i. <br>

                  1 degree. It does nothing to eliminate tipping, which stretches the 
                  screw and is the main cause of loosening. Paragon’s friction-fit abutments 
                  now come with a worldwide guarantee of no loose screws for five years.</font></p>

                  The "micro-stops" in the 3i abutments. Are these just the metal flashings

                  What they do is broach (force) a hex to be formed of a smaller size 
                  and then go in with the right size broach that leaves some metal fragments 
                  up inside the abutment. These fragments hit the top of the implant’s 
                  hex when the screw is tightened and gives the temporary appearance of 
                  tightness. Since it does not stop tipping, these metal fragments eventually 
                  flatten out and the parts can rotate and tip.</font></p>

                  While Paragon is an excellent internal hex system, many of the participants 
                  in this group seem to use the external hex. I understand all that Dr. 
                  Niznick is saying about 3i surface and, at present, can't find fault. 
                  But if you like the external hex and like the advantages of the Paragon 
                  surface, why not look at Lifecore's RBM implant? Paragon and Lifecore, 
                  if I am not misguided, are both surfaced at the same location with the 
                  same technique. </font></p>

                  You are right that they are both similar surfaces. While Paragon started 
                  having its surfaces blasted by the same company as Lifecore and BioHorizons 
                  still use, we have switched vendors for better quality control. Dr. 
                  Gordon Christenssen comments on the economic advantages of Paragon implants 
                  and Binon studies show it to be superior in hex fit. Lifecore started 
                  out being a low priced implant, but now has a list price of $220 for 
                  its RBM surface implant (5mmD). They will sell at a different price 
                  to everyone (I've seen invoices as low as $100), depending on your negotiating 
                  skills. Paragon's external hex Taper-Lock implant that Binon also studied 
                  and referred to as the ultimate connection because of its tapered design 
                  and friction-fit connection, has a published price of $143. Since July 
                  1, 1999, the Taper-Lock can be ordered over the Internet for as low 
                  as $132 for individual implant orders and $121 for orders of 20 or more. 
                  It will be economical for everyone. This price includes Fixture Mount/Transfer 
                  packaging, which saves the cost of a transfer, and is provided in 3 
                  diameters, all with the same platform for prosthetic simplicity. It 
                  has Paragon's patented Selective Surface for efficient, self-tapping 
                  insertion, and is made of work-hardened, Grade 4 commercially pure titanium 
                  (cpTi) with a tensile strength of 112 ksi vs. Lifecore's Grade 3 cpTi 
                  at 65 ksi. Paragon manufactures all its own implants, thereby assuring 
                  quality control. In contrast, Lifecore utilizes machine shops. </font></p>

                  the FDA report on fractured implants that was reported on the IHS Medical

                  and Lifecore-0 (zero). Paragon has never had a report of a fractured 
                  Taper-Lock external hex implant and the fractures you refer to were 
                  mostly small-diameter Screw-Vents when we were making them out of CP

                  I became a user of the Core-Vent Implant System back in the mid 1980s 
                  and I thank God that I didn't place more than a couple hundred of those 
                  bendable cemented abutment heads that ultimately fractured! After using 
                  Core-Vent, Screw-Vent, Sterri-Oss, Calcitek and ITI/Straumann implant 
                  systems, I can honestly say that the Straumann implant is the way to 
                  go, period! </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b><font size="6">A:</font></b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  I was recently sent a panoramic radiograph of a 17-year follow-up of 
                  a fixed bridge on the narrow bendable heads done by a prosthodontist. 
                  While we had a higher than expected incidence of breakage, a lot had 
                  to do with how many implants were used, how long the span was, the angle 
                  of implant placement and how passive the framework fit. The bendable 
                  head abutment was used with blade implants for decades. Core-vent also 
                  offered the first castable abutment heads in 1982. Both were crude methods 
                  of dealing with angulation problems that were not even being addressed 
                  by the Br&aring;nemark System. I made the bendable heads out of commercially 
                  pure titanium. This material was weaker, but more ductile than the titanium 
                  alloy used for the implant to ensure that the abutment could be more 
                  easily ground out, if fractured. By 1986, the bendable heads were replaced 
                  by cementable, titanium alloy non-bendable heads that fit flush with 
                  the top of the implant. During the same year, the internal hex connection 
                  was invented for the Screw-Vent and ultimately replaced cemented heads. 
                  So much for ancient history.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As for the Straumann system, 
                  it certainly had its evolutionary problems as well. In the 1980s, they 
                  sold a basket implant with a neck that was narrower than the body, creating 
                  a defect at the crest of the ridge. Consequently, they redesigned their 
                  implant and, in 1991, came back into the American market with the Bonefit 
                  basket implant with external threads. This implant infringed the Core-Vent 
                  patent and ultimately, after a week trial, Straumann was found liable 
                  for a considerable amount and enjoined from selling the implant that 
                  all their research was based on. After 6 months, they decided to take 
                  out a license, paid me even more money and sold this implant until the 
                  license ran out last year. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To avoid paying any more 
                  royalties or to solve their implant breakage problems with this thin-walled 
                  basket design, Straumann's implants have evolved into a non-self-tapping, 
                  solid screw implant with a round bottom. This implant, called the ITI 
                  System, had a conical connection without an internal indexing means 
                  (hex or octagon) until this year. As a result, they could not do transfers, 
                  nor could they make the abutment hit on the internal taper and on the 
                  periphery at the same time. Therefore the top of the implant become 
                  the margin of the restoration. This presented numerous prosthetic and 
                  esthetic limitations that most dentists are aware of. Several years 
                  ago, ITI experienced a rash of breakages with their conical abutments, 
                  which necessitated an FDA recall. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Straumann finally acknowledged 
                  the need for internal indexing by incorporating an internal octagon 
                  on all the implants they are now manufacturing (still selling some odd 
                  sizes in the old design). Straumann's internal octagon violates Paragon's 
                  internal wrench engaging patent and we have filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles 
                  Federal Court. Apparently the Swiss need another lesson in violating 
                  my patents. Eight other companies have already learned this lesson including 
                  3i, Lifecore, Steri-Oss and Calcitek.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You should get a copy of 
                  my CD-ROM to better understand the prosthetic limitations of using a 
                  system where the margins of the restoration are established at the time 
                  of surgical placement or where there is no transfer capability. If this 
                  doesn’t persuade you to take a second look at Core-Vent/Paragon, then 
                  you should be happy to learn that Paragon is now making an ITI clone 
                  and selling it for the same price it sells the Taper-Lock external hex 
                  implant; $121 each. I feel compelled to do this because Straumann has 
                  chosen to violate my patent rather than negotiate a license. Since the 
                  patent also includes abutments that fit into the internal hexagon/octagon 
                  of an implant, Straumann may soon find themselves with thousands of 
                  internal octagon implants inserted, but without the ability to sell 
                  the abutments or transfers to go with these implants. Paragon will be 
                  able to meet these needs and transition their customers into a better-packaged 
                  and more reasonably priced implants.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since Paragon’s SwissPlus 
                  clone has an internal octagon, we provide it suspended on a fixture 
                  mount that simplifies insertion. It has one flat side so it can serve 
                  as a transfer, and is tapered so it can also serve as a preparable abutment 
                  (saving $105). Unlike Straumann's implant, it will come packaged with 
                  a cover screw (saving $20–$40). The fact that our ITI clone will be 
                  priced at $121 for a 20-implant order over the Internet represents about 
                  70% savings compared to ITI's price for all the components. You will 
                  also be able to prepare the margins and take conventional impressions 
                  for further savings by not having to buy impression transfers and abutment 
                  analogs.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The improved design, packaging 
                  and cost savings should get the attention of even the most devoted ITI 
                  advocate.</font></p>

                  Thanks for that very enlightening response. I in fact did have six ITI 
                  abutments fracture and, although it was not a big deal to retrieve the 
                  broken piece from the implants involved, it was a nuisance nonetheless. 
                  Yes, those bendable necks from your original implant system were "a 
                  bummer" for me, but if it hadn't been for one of your lectures in the 
                  mid-1980s, I probably wouldn't have ever gotten involved in implants 
                  as a general dentist (placing as well as restoring them), period. I 
                  now place implants for over 65 referring general dentists and I honestly 
                  love the ITI system. Admittedly, it has a few shortcomings, which you 
                  have cited in your response, but I haven't truly found these limitations 
                  to be too restricting in clinical practice. Single-stage implants offer 
                  numerous advantages to the patient, as well as to the dentists, as I 
                  am sure you are aware. I'm certain that will be the future of implant 
                  dentistry as more and more dentists switch from two-stage to single 
                  stage implants. I am most happy to hear of your plans with the ITI clone! 
                  When will it become commercially available? Also, what type of surface 
                  will it have? TPS or SLA? Also, what is your take on the SLA surface 
                  that ITI has recently introduced with reduced healing time prior to 
                  loading?</font></p>

                  Thank you for confirming my comments about the breakage and for acknowledging 
                  my contribution to your implant career. Paragon's SwissPlus is now available 
                  and has an SBM surface that is created by blasting with a soluble tricalcium 
                  phosphate. This process uses a rather soft material to create a medium-rough 
                  surface without overly rounding the threads. You can check out the difference 
                  on our web site at ../ research/controversy/contro1_pt07-5.html. Both 
                  SLA and SBM have large (25u) craters and small (1-2u) pits compared 
                  to TPS with 40u interconnecting pores that can be a problem if it becomes 
                  exposed to the soft tissue. This is why Straumann changed to SLA, not 
                  because it can be loaded earlier.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1986, the Core-Vent implant 
                  was blasted with large particles of aluminum oxide followed by acid 
                  etching to remove the blast contaminants. The initials, &quot;SLA,&quot; 
                  stand for &quot;Sandblasted with Large particles followed by Acid etching&quot; 
                  (HF/NO3 in the case of Core-Vent, HC/Sulfuric in the case of Straumann). 
                  SLA is not a new process nor does it have any unique advantages. In 
                  fact, this two-step, aggressive process has the significant disadvantage 
                  of rounding any threads or self-tapping cutting edges on the implant. 
                  Straumann does not design their implant to be self-tapping, as it has 
                  no grooves or vents at the apex, or any vertical cutting grooves. It 
                  only has a few rounded threads, widely spaced. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You don't have to wait for 
                  the ITI clone or to find out if the ITI implant, with the internal octagon, 
                  will be taken off the market because of the patent violations. The Advent 
                  has many advantages over the ITI implant or even the Paragon’s clone

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Triple lead threads for 
                  faster insertion and more threaded surface area;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. SBM surface preserves 
                  the sharpness of the threads compared to SLA;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Advent is also available 
                  with HA coating below a 2 mm SBM zone;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Tapered design for bone 
                  expansion or compression or anatomical limitations;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. The ability to be used 
                  1- or 2-stage with a prepackaged Implant Extender and low-profile cover 
                  screw that allow positioning 1 mm to 5 mm above the crest of the ridge. 
                  ITI requires purchase of a 1 mm healing cap at $20 or 2 mm to 5 mm healing 
                  caps for $40. ITI also offers two implant versions with 1.8 mm and 2.8 
                  mm necks. The Advent’s variable height design eliminates the need for 
                  this type of duplicate inventory;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Friction-fit abutments

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Tapered straight and angled 
                  abutments with preparable margins. They fit flush with the outside diameter 
                  of the implant, which allows preparation of margins that follow the

                  as a shoulder margin, as with the ITI implant. This improves esthetics 
                  and allows use of conventional impressions, which saves the cost of 
                  transfers and abutment analogs. Paragon's ITI clone, the SwissPlus, 
                  also offers a flush-fitting fixture mount that can be used as a straight 
                  preparable abutment. It accepts all of ITI's conical abutments and, 
                  depending on demand, Paragon may also make two-piece angled abutments 
                  and clones of Straumann's other abutments for both the SwissPlus and 
                  ITI implants.</font></p>

                  Straumann’s new internal octagon, which is the subject of the patent

                  insertion if its fixture mount is removed. Straumann's implant is package 
                  with a fixture mount that relies on thread engagement for insertion 
                  This requires an awkward method of using two tools to detach the fixture 
                  mount: one to stabilize the mount while the other loosens the center

                  of threaded surface as a Branemark or Screw-Vent, but goes in 3 times 
                  faster, because it has three independent threads starting 120 degrees 
                  apart and intertwining with each other. The space between the individual 
                  threads is 1.8 mm but together, adjacent threads are only 0.6 mm apart, 
                  like a standard Br&aring;nemark thread. Paragon's Screw-Vent has Selective 
                  Surface with the apical 3 mm uncoated or unblasted to keep the cutting 
                  edge sharp for self-tapping. The Advent, on the other hand, has an SBM 
                  roughened surface to the apex where it also has an apical vent and vertical 
                  cutting grooves for self-tapping. As this tapered design is inserted 
                  into a straight hole, the lower half of the implant partially cuts threads 
                  in the bone while mainly expanding or compressing the bone with the 
                  upper half of the implant. The surgeon varies the amount of bone expansion/compression 
                  desired by the size of the hole that is cut before inserting the implant. 
                  For example, to insert a 3.7 mmD implant in soft bone, the final drill 
                  is 2.8 mm D. To insert the same implant in dense bone, the final drill 
                  is 3.2 mmD. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As when Core-Vent introduced 
                  the first Branemark clone, called the Swede-Vent implant, in 1987, the 
                  purpose of the ITI clone (i.e. SwissPlus) is not to endorse this design, 
                  but due to the fact that we can retain the original design of the implant 
                  while making prosthetic and packaging improvements and offering it for 
                  a lower cost. As demonstrated above, if you are looking for a design 
                  that is significantly better than the ITI implant, while still keeping 
                  true to the one-stage protocol with the fluted neck emergence profile, 
                  the Advent is the obvious choice.</font></p>

                  I do not agree that just burying the 2.8 mm collar 1 mm deeper is the 
                  answer. If the biologic width literature is accurate then you'll get 
                  saucerization of bone in relation to the buried microgap.</font></p>

                  Response:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> What 
                  buried microgap? The top of the implant will still be 1.8 mm above the 
                  crest of the ridge if you dropped 1 mm of the machined neck below the 
                  crest. I don't know any literature related to biological width and implants. 
                  This is just a theory extrapolated from teeth to implants. If it were 
                  true, then there should be no bone loss around an ITI implant because 
                  the microgap is well above the bone. In a study by Hammerle, however, 
                  ITI implants lost 1 mm of bone and exposed the TPS. Hammerle showed 
                  that when he pushed the TPS 1 mm subcrestal, bone ran down the smooth 
                  machined surface and still exposed the TPS. This study resulted in two 
                  things with the ITI system. One was the introduction of implants with 
                  just 1.8 mm of a machined neck for subgingival margin case. The other 
                  is that Straumann eventually changed to an SLA surface. It was apparent 
                  that the rough TPS would eventually become exposed, anyway. A recent 
                  article compared the Astra implant, which features a surface blasted 
                  all the way to the top, side-by-side with the Branemark implant, which 
                  has a plain machined surface. The study showed no significant difference 
                  in bone loss between the two implants. What these two studies together 
                  show is that you are going to get bone loss and that what becomes exposed 
                  should not be so rough as to collect plaque. The VA study showed that 
                  bone loss was related to bone thickness surrounding the implant at time 
                  of placement. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a subgingival margin 
                  is desired and the tissue is thin, the idea behind dropping 1 mm of 
                  the 2.8 mmL machined surface into the bone is to create a subgingival 
                  margin when the tissue is thin. This eliminates the need to maintain 
                  an inventory of two implant types that differ only in the lengths of 
                  their machined necks, such as Straumann requires (2.8mm neck and 1.8mm 
                  neck). I decided not to make the short neck implant because the chance 
                  of loosing 1 mm of crestal bone is of no clinical significance. Doubling 
                  one’s inventory of implants just to avoid 1mm of machined neck subcrestal, 
                  on the other hand, is a real practical concern. </font></p>

                  5 mm gap (and ours is about 3 microns). So, what Cochran did to ingratiate 
                  himself to Straumann is create a phony study to support the ITI design 
                  theory that you needed to keep the implant/junction at least 2 mm away 
                  from the crest or you would get bone loss. </font></p>

                  are fooling yourself. Do you create a shoulder around every tooth preparation? 
                  I doubt it. Even for porcelain jacket crowns where you would require 
                  a shoulder preparation, you do not prepare it at the same height around 
                  the entire tooth. You follow the tissue contours. So, why in the world 
                  would you want to be forced to restore to a shoulder around the implant 
                  at the same height above the bone, and ignore differences in tissue 
                  contours? I can’t imagine any periodontist that would recommend a 3-4mm 
                  subgingival cemented margin, which often occurs on the lingual, just 
                  so you can get the labial margin 1 mm below the tissue. </font></p>

                  margin on the lingual and interproximal surfaces and only create a shoulder 
                  on the labial IF you need room for porcelain. Subgingival margins with 
                  porcelain shoulders are not really needed for lower posterior restorations. 
                  In the esthetic zone, a two-piece implant, such as the Tapered Screw-Vent,

                  Abutment selection can take place, as is presently the case, in the

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If one wanted to make a custom-cast 
                  abutment for the old ITI, one had to attach the Octabutment&#210; , 
                  make a transfer impression, wax up and cast to a gold coping that extends 
                  over the shoulder of the ITI implant, attach the gold coping to the 
                  Octabutment in the mouth, and then make a conventional impression to 
                  fabricate a fixed prosthesis. The average cost would be in excess of 
                  $400 per abutment unit, plus a lot of wasted chair time. Straumann now 
                  offers a castable plastic pattern in lieu of the gold coping. However, 
                  it is designed to snap over the undercut of the implant, and then requires 
                  dressing down the overlap once it has been cast. This adds to the inaccuracy 
                  of the margin. Such inaccuracy is eliminated by SwissPlus, which allows 
                  dentists to attach a full-contour abutment directly to the implant in 
                  the mouth, prepare the margins intraorally, make a conventional impression 
                  and pour up a stone die. Alternatively, a transfer can be made since 
                  there is an internal octagon in the SwissPlus and synOcta&#210; implants. 
                  The titanium abutment can then be prepared on the working cast. Paragon 
                  offers a combination abutment/transfer for use with the synOcta implant. 
                  This component is not required with the SwissPlus implant, since the 
                  fixture mount also serves as a transfer and preparable abutment. This 
                  fixture mount is indexed for accurate orientation of our SwissPlus 20-degree 
                  Angled Abutment. If the flat is placed to the labial, the Angled Abutment 
                  will be directed to the lingual. </font></p>

                  seem to have to wait to see how Straumann's new stuff holds up for a 
                  few years before you use it. How do you know the internal octagon, which 
                  reduces the surface area of their conical connection, will "hold up" 
                  and not cause more implant breakage or loose abutments? Our implant 
                  uses work-hardened Grade 4 Ti. Its surface treatment is very similar 
                  to SLA, but does not round the threads. The self-tapping feature and 
                  sharp threads will ensure a tighter initial fit with the SwissPlus, 
                  which should enhance success in poor quality bone. Unlike the synOcta 
                  or regular ITI implant, the apical end of the SwissPlus is tapered. 
                  This facilitates initiation into an undersized socket prepared in soft 
                  bone to provide better initial stability. Our implant comes with a healing 
                  collar and fixture mount/transfer/abutment that would have to be bought 
                  separately from Straumann.. Our transfers and abutments, as demonstrated 
                  in our SwissPlus website, fit our implants with a smoother margin than 
                  any custom cast abutment you could fit onto the shoulder of an ITI. 
                  SwissPlus’ product versatility and compatibility with the ITI implant 
                  is demonstrated on the attached slide. Surgeons will appreciate the 
                  use of a fixture mount that engages the internal octagon, because it 
                  simplifies insertion and can be easily removed without the need for 
                  counter-torque, as with the ITI system. Lifecore's ITI clone engaged

                  external hex implants, or had breakage from the Grade 1 CP Ti. Their

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="6">Q:</font>&#9;</b>After 
                    viewing www.straumann-clone.com, I must admit that Paragon’s SwissPlus 
                    System looks absolutely irresistible. However, why no small diameter 
                    implant? I find that I often need a 3.3mm diameter implant, especially 
                    in the maxillary lateral incisor area.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="6">A:</font> &#9;</b>When placing an implant in the upper lateral area of the jaw, 
                    where mesial-distal space is limited, you most likely need an implant 
                    with a small diameter platform. That is why I think that Straumann's 
                    3.3mmD implant with a 4.8mmD ITI platform makes no sense. Straumann 
                    does make an implant with a small diameter platform and a tall external 
                    hex. However, due to the stacking height of its abutment components, 
                    especially if an angled abutment is required, this design has its 
                    esthetic limitations.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paragon’s 
                    narrow Screw-Vent implant with a 3.3mmD body and a 3.5mmD platform 
                    is a more practical design for accommodating narrow ridges and limited 
                    mesial-distal space. In addition to its smaller diameter platform, 
                    the narrow Screw-Vent implant features Paragon’s patented internal 
                    hex. When used in conjunction with Paragon’s friction-fit abutments, 
                    a much stronger and lower profile abutment connection can be achieved. 
                    One can then select either straight or angled abutments and prepare 
                    the margin as far sub-gingival as necessary for esthetics.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Available 
                    in January 2000, the new tapered Screw-Vent implant provides the same 
                    standard 3.5mmD platform as the narrow 3.3mmD Screw-Vent. Its reengineered 
                    tapered body, with a slightly wider 3.7mmD neck and a body that tapers 
                    down to 2.5mm at its apical end, eliminates the need for a 3.3mmD 
                    implant. During placement in soft bone, the tapered Screw-Vent will 
                    gradually expand the ridge of an osteotomy prepared with a straight 
                    2.8mmD drill, thus providing increased initial stability. This special 
                    feature also offers the benefits of greater implant body strength 
                    and greater surface area than the current 3.3mmD narrow Screw-Vent 
                    implant without increasing the diameter of the implant’s platform. 
                    Its innovative design makes it an ideal choice for replacing upper 
                    and lower lateral incisors (especially lower central incisors). </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ITI concept 
                    of using the top of the implant as the shoulder of the restoration 
                    is also poorly conceived. For a ceramo-metal crown, one would never 
                    prepare a shoulder on an anterior tooth all around the circumference 
                    of a tooth at the same height because it complicates impressions. 
                    Straumann's design requires transfer jigs, centering sleeves and analogs 
                    to capture the impression of this shoulder. Even if one were preparing 
                    a tooth for a porcelain jacket, it is not advisable to create the 
                    shoulder at the same height above the crest of the ridge all the way 
                    around the tooth. Instead, the preparation would follow the contour 
                    of the soft tissue so that the margin would be the same depth sub-gingival. 
                    Full contour emergence profile abutments that cover the shoulder of 
                    the SwissPlus (or for use with ITI's synOcta implant) allow such latitude 
                    in establishing the margins with a minimum of sub-gingival depth.

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Straumann's 
                    own realization of the limitations of its design has lead it to venture 
                    into violating my patent by incorporating an internal octagon for 
                    transfer capabilities. They fail to take full advantage of this internal 
                    anti-rotational feature by still advocating their solid abutments, 
                    leaving the shoulder exposed. Alternately, Straumann recommends attaching 
                    the Octabutment&reg; , directly or indirectly following making a transfer 
                    impression, and using a gold coping that covers the shoulder to fabricate 
                    a custom cast abutment. This does allow positioning of the margins 
                    at varying heights and fabrication of angled abutments. It may require 
                    a second impression and is unnecessarily complicated and expensive. 
                    Paragon's SwissPlus provides a 2-piece fixture-mount that covers the 
                    shoulder of the implant and can be used as the transfer for indirect 
                    preparation, or shortened chairside and then prepared in the mouth.

                    not be making clones of Straumann's ITI's Esthetic Plus series of 
                    implants with the blasting or coating running 1 mm higher than the 
                    standard implant. This design is recommended by Straumann for placement 
                    when only 2mm of the neck is desired to be projecting above the crest 
                    of bone for esthetic sub-gingival margins. It is another example of 
                    Straumann's lack of appreciation of the cost to dentists of holding 
                    large implant inventories. One can easily drop 1mm of the 2.8mm machined 
                    neck of the SwissPlus or ITI implant sub-crestal and achieve the same 
                    esthetic results. It is not worth stockpiling a different implant 
                    inventory just to keep the machined neck from being 1mm sub-crestal. 
                    A recent study comparing the machined surface Br&aring;nemark Implant 
                    to the Astra Implant, blasted to the top, showed no difference in 
                    bone loss after a year. </font></p>

                      the internal and external connection Steri-Oss Replace implants 
                      require their fixture mounts to be removed and longer fixture mounts 
                      to be attached before the implants can be fully seated in the same 
                      situation. </font></p>

                      Advent Implant is designed for a one-stage surgical protocol and 
                      is packaged with a 2 mm implant extender that provides additional 
                      height to accommodate variations in soft tissue thickness. The 3 
                      mm long machined neck of the implant can be placed 1 mm or 2 mm 
                      sub-crestal for a two-stage procedure. Therefore, Paragon's implants 
                      are true one-stage designs with the implant-abutment junction well 
                      above the crest of the ridge. Nobel/Steri-Oss claims that its Replace 
                      Select Implant can be used as a one-stage implant by using a protocol 
                      that requires leaving the 2 mm smooth neck of the implant above 
                      the crest of the ridge. This places the TPS or HA coated surfaces 
                      at the crest of the ridge where they will become readily exposed 
                      to the soft tissue when bone loss occurs. Since 2 mm is usually 
                      not enough to protrude through the soft tissue, Replace Select require 
                      buying and attaching a healing collar to use the implant one-stage.

                      medium rough, blasted surface that has been shown in animal studies 
                      to provide increased bone contact compared to TPS, and even equally

                      </font><font face="Arial">I seem to have more than the expected 
                      number of acid-etched Replace<sup>®</sup> implants rotating out 
                      at the &quot;second-stage&quot; counter-torque test (i.e. hand pressure). 
                      However, I also experienced several larger diameter Replace implants 
                      which passed the hand torque test, but which slightly rotated when 
                      torqued to 35 Ncm. In these latter cases, I advised the restorative 
                      dentists to temporize and retest after 3 to 6 months, and they seem 
                      to have successfully reintegrated. I was concerned with these experiences 
                      and I sent my statistical results on about 200 Replace implants 
                      to Mr. Don Kennard at Nobel Biocare in California. I was unaware 
                      of anyone else having a similar experience with the acid-etched 
                      Replace. This may be due to the fact that the surface is too smooth. 
                      All the Replace implants are titanium alloy, which is harder than 
                      commercially pure titanium . Consequently, the harder alloyed metal 
                      will not have as much roughness after machining in comparison to 
                      the softer commercially pure metal! As a result, I recently returned 
                      all of my acid-etched Replace implants and have substituted them 
                      with TPS and HA Replace implants.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Regarding the Replace Select (internal 
                      tripod connection), so far all the restorative dentists have been 
                      very pleased. The response has been similar to the excellent tactile 
                      sense with the internal hex of the Paragon system. I guess the competition 
                      is agreeing with Gerry Niznick that an internal connection is better 
                      than an external connection. Can anyone comment on how the Select 
                      connection compares to the &quot;friction fit&quot; Paragon internal 
                      hex connection?</font></p>

                      <font face="Arial">Thank you for the invitation to compare the Steri-Oss 
                      Replace Select vs. Paragon's internal hex implants, which I first 
                      introduced in 1986. In recent journals, Nobel Biocare has run two-page 
                      ads with the Branemark external hex implant on the left and the 
                      Replace Select implant on the right. The Branemark implant has now 
                      incorporated what they call &quot;Stargrip&quot; for easier insertion. 
                      It is nothing more than an internal hex with flats instead of points. 
                      In 1982, the Core-Vent<sup>®</sup> internal hex implant first simplified 
                      delivery and placement of an implant into a surgical site by allowing 
                      a hex tool to be inserted into the implant . I never thought I would 
                      see an external hex implant with an internal hex for insertion. 
                      Why retain the external hex at all? On the right side of Nobel Biocare's 
                      two-page spread, the Replace Select ad states &quot;what every dentist 
                      wants...an internal connection.&quot; I guess this means that Nobel 
                      Biocare built the world's largest implant business by selling dentists 
                      WHAT THEY DON'T WANT...external hex Branemark<sup>®</sup> and Steri-Oss 
                      implants. This is a testament to those dentists who are willing 
                      to be manipulated by marketing rhetoric and purchased opinion leaders. 
                      It is now happening again with the Steri-Oss Replace implant. Beyond 
                      the smooth surface, there are also significant design shortcomings 
                      to the Steri-Oss Replace tapered implant that I believe contribute 
                      to the higher failure rate that you have observed.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"> <font face="Arial"><b>SURFACE:</b> Steri-Oss uses 
                      the same hydrofluoric/nitric acid etching technique that Core-Vent 
                      used prior to 1997. The results of the VA study (J Oral Maxillofac 
                      Surg 1997; 55 (12) Suppl 5) convinced me that a rougher surface 
                      was needed, especially in soft bone. As for Steri-Oss' other two 
                      surface options, TPS and HA, the TPS does not provide as much bone 
                      attachment as a medium-rough blasted surface, as documented in studies 
                      by both Paragon and Straumann. As bone recedes down the smooth neck 
                      of the Replace implant, the porous TPS becomes exposed to the soft 
                      tissue, which can cause a problem. This was most likely why Straumann 
                      changed the surface of the ITI implant from the porous, rough, TPS 
                      surface to its current, medium-rough, non-porous, SLA-blasted surface. 
                      Paragon's straight Screw-Vent<sup>®</sup> implant offers TPS (rough 
                      &amp; porous), HA-coated (rough) and SBM™ (Soluble Blasting Medium) 
                      -blasted (medium-rough) surfaces. Our new Tapered Screw-Vent, which 
                      will eventually replace the straight Screw-Vent, only features uncoated 
                      SBM surface and HA-coated surface options. Replace Select also offers 
                      HA coating, which can also become rapidly exposed as bone recedes 
                      down the smooth neck. The Tapered Screw-Vent includes Paragon's 
                      patented HA Dual Transition™ Selective Surface™ that provides 1mm 
                      of a machined neck and 2mm of medium rough, SBM-blasted surface 
                      interposed between the smooth neck and the HA coating. This safety 
                      zone is designed to impede bone recession and exposure of the HA 
                      coating. If one follows Steri-Oss' instructions to use the Replace 
                      Select implant in a one-stage surgical procedure by leaving its 
                      2mm long smooth neck exposed above the crest of the ridge, the HA 
                      or TPS rough surfaces will be positioned at the crest, assuring 
                      early exposure to the soft tissue. Paragon offers the AdVent implant, 
                      which is designed specifically for one-stage surgery. It has the 
                      body of the Tapered Screw-Vent with a 3mm smooth neck designed to 
                      project through the soft tissue and also serve as an abutment for 
                      screw-retained restorations. This implant is packaged with a 2mm 
                      implant extender to facilitate one-stage placement, whether the 
                      soft tissue is 2mm thick or 5mm thick!</font></p>
                    <p align="left"> <font face="Arial"><b>THREAD DESIGN:</b> Steri-Oss 
                      implants provide the industry's only upside down threads, which 
                      feature less thread surface than the conventional threads of the 
                      Branemark or Screw-Vent implants. Almost every screw implant design 
                      today, including the Branemark, 3i, Calcitek and Lifecore, have 
                      followed Screw-Vent's 1986 lead of incorporating self-tapping apical 
                      features. The Steri-Oss Replace and Replace Select implants, on 
                      the other hand, lack any self-tapping vertical grooves or slots. 
                      They even lack any apical threads for bicortical stabilization. 
                      The threads of Steri-Oss Replace implants actually fade away to 
                      nothing several millimeters from the apex.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Initial stability is critical for 
                      achieving osseointegration. This is enhanced by self-tapping insertion, 
                      increased thread surface and rougher surfaces. In addition, the 
                      Tapered Screw-Vent, with its unique, patented, triple lead threads 
                      for 3 times faster insertion, offers a soft bone surgical protocol 
                      of inserting the tapered implant into an undersized socket. The 
                      resulting bone expansion provides even greater initial stability.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"> <font face="Arial"><b>AND LETS NOT FORGET COST AND 
                      VALUE: </b>Tapered Screw-Vents sell for considerably less than the 
                      Replace Select Implant ($235-240 vs. $268), and offer either a blasted 
                      surface or an HA-coated, Dual Transition Selective Surface that's 
                      blasted between the smooth 1mm neck and the HA coating. Tapered 
                      Screw-Vents offer added value because they are mounted on fixture 
                      mounts that can be used as transfers and as a temporary abutments.</font></p>

                      there any dentists who have been experiencing &quot;more than the 
                      expected&quot; number of &quot;early failures&quot; with TPS Replace 
                      implants? Some of you may recall previous discussions over concerns 
                      that acid-etched titanium Replace implants may lack adequate mechanical 
                      retention. In my experience, this problem with the titanium Replace 
                      implants typically manifested itself at the time of &quot;osseointegration 
                      verification.&quot; Some Replace implants would unscrew out of the 
                      bone when removing the healing abutments, while others would turn 
                      slightly when torquing the final abutments. I theorized that this 
                      is due to the relatively smooth titanium alloy surface combined 
                      with the lack of aggressive apical threads. The result was an implant 
                      design with insufficient mechanical retention.</font></p>
                    <p align="left"> <font face="Arial">The pattern of the TPS failures 
                      I have recently experienced is different</font> <font face="Arial">from 
                      the titanium implants. With the TPS, there has been an acute reaction 
                      within days after initial placement. Typically, there is a loss 
                      of the facial bone and a deep pocket. The implants are not mobile, 
                      but can be easily counter-torqued out of the bone. My hypothesis 
                      to explain this phenomenon with the TPS Replace is different, however, 
                      from that of the titanium Replace. Perhaps the thicker TPS coating 
                      on this particular design results in too much compaction of the 
                      hard tissue, and thus leads to a higher risk of pressure necrosis 
                      in the bone. I am not condemning TPS on other designs, as I have 
                      had excellent success using the TPS ITI system, with up to 6 years 
                      of follow-up.</font></p>
                    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
                    <p align="left"><b> <font face="Arial" size="6">A: </font></b><font face="Arial">In 
                      addition to avoiding the overheating of bone during surgery, initial 
                      stability is the main factor in achieving osseointegration. The 
                      threads of the Replace implant are upside down, with too shallow 
                      a depth and too much flat space between the threads. As you pointed 
                      out, there are no apical threads. Replace is a tapered implant that 
                      is inserted into a tapered hole. Therefore, the threads do not start 
                      to engage the receptor site until the implant is inserted approximately 
                      half way. The implant is not self-tapping in dense bone (i.e. a 
                      bone tap is required), which reduces initial stability. In soft 
                      bone, the round apex hits the bottom of the osteotomy and any further 
                      turning will strip the threads in the bone. Without apical threads, 
                      there is no chance for bicortical stabilization, which is so critical 
                      in soft bone. HA may overcome these design limitations but, as you 
                      pointed out in a previous report, the smooth acid-etched surface 
                      has not consistently achieved osseointegration. Now you are reporting 
                      that TPS on the Replace has a problem. Perhaps it is the fact that 
                      applying TPS coating rounds off the sharp cutting edges of the threads. 
                      This further reduces initial stability and more easily allows for 
                      stripping of the threads once the implant has bottomed out. Because 
                      the Replace implants are tapered and inserted with a tapered drill, 
                      they require a different drill for each implant length. This means 
                      that, to place three lengths and four diameters (12 implants), a 
                      dentist must buy 12 drills and four bone taps. The self-tapping 
                      Tapered Screw-Vent and AdVent one-stage implants are inserted into 
                      a socket prepared with straight drills. Therefore the three diameters 
                      in four lengths (12 implants) only require three final sizing drills. 
                      The Tapered Screw-Vent offers the industry's only soft-bone/hard-bone 
                      protocol. In soft bone, the intermediate drill is used as the final 
                      drill (a tapered implant design is essential for this procedure). 
                      The final drills are step-drills, which allow the narrow apex to 
                      engage the dense bone and easily self-tap during placement. Using 
                      a bone expansion/compression procedure in soft bone increases initial 
                      stability and enhances the ability to load implants early in soft 
                      bone.</font></p>

                    366mhz processor. I just ordered the new Inspiron 5000<sup>&reg;</sup> 
                    with a Pentium III<sup>&reg;</sup> 500mhz processor that steps up 
                    to 650mhz when operating on AC current. Only Sony and Dell currently 
                    offer this new step-up technology, which initiates a fan to cool it 
                    when operating off of AC current. The Paragon Implant System is to 
                    implants as the Inspiron 5000 is to laptops today—cutting-edge technology. 
                    The Branemark<sup>&reg;</sup> System and its clones are stuck somewhere 
                    between the 286 and 486 chip technology. Branemark has the best research 
                    to prove the limitations of its relatively smooth surface in poor 
                    quality bone and Grade 1 commercially pure titanium, with regard to 
                    implant weakness, hex distortion and screw loosening.</font></p>

                    $3,000,000 in co-funding a government study conducted by the Department 
                    of Veterans Affairs at 32 Study Centers. In fact, the U.S. government 
                    contributed triple that amount in treatment time alone! If nothing 
                    else, the study proved that HA surfaces worked significantly better 
                    than acid-etched surfaces in soft bone. These results held true regardless 
                    of whether the implants were placed by inexperienced operators, implanted 
                    in smokers, failed to achieve initial stability, or were inserted 
                    into patients without preoperative antibiotics! This was a double-blind, 
                    double peer-reviewed study that compared 2 to 3 different implant

                    ON YOUR MODULE: You credit Branemark with discovering osseointegrated 
                    implants dating back to 1952. This is just part of the marketing myth 
                    created by Nobelpharma (now called Nobel Biocare). In 1969, Branemark 
                    tried to get a patent on a two-stage implant, but was turned down 
                    because several French two-stage implants had already been patented. 
                    In Branemark's 1977 textbook, he credits [Gottlieb and] Leventhal 
                    (1951) for being the first to report bone attachment to titanium. 
                    After that, however, Nobelpharma/Nobel Biocare claimed that he discovered 
                    this process and never referenced Leventhal again. When, in litigation, 
                    Core-Vent claimed this was false advertising, Nobelpharma/Nobel Biocare 
                    acknowledged this by changing "Branemark discovered osseointegration" 
                    to "Branemark observed osseointegration." </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You list the 
                    Branemark<sup>&reg;</sup> implant as "tried and true." If the Branemark 
                    implant were so reliable, Nobel Biocare wouldn't have had to introduce 
                    four variations to this design and then buy Steri-Oss to be competitive. 
                    In the late 1980s, Nobelpharma/Nobel Biocare introduced the conical 
                    neck Branemark self-tapping implant, which was very quickly pulled 
                    off the market in Canada for excessive bone loss. This design quietly 
                    disappeared in the U.S. Nobel Biocare recently reintroduced the implant 
                    with the recommendation that the long, unthreaded neck be used for 
                    one-stage procedures. Their second attempt at a self-tapping implant 
                    was the Mk II<sup>&reg;</sup>, which had very deep apical grooves 
                    that eliminated most of the thread surface in the apical 4 mm of the 
                    implant body. This, like its replacement, the Mk III<sup>&reg;</sup> 
                    and Mk IV<sup>&reg;</sup> implants, cannot be used self-tapping in 
                    dense bone because the hex strips at about 9 in/lbs. In contrast, 
                    Paragon's internal hex strips at 18 in-lbs and our Advent at 32 in-lbs. 
                    The Branemark Mk II has now been replaced with the Mk III (without 
                    apical grooves) and the Mk IV (slightly tapered for soft bone expansion). 
                    The Mk IV is an attempt to overcome the well published higher failure 
                    rates in soft bone with the Branemark implant, while keeping their 
                    machined-only surface (a cause of the higher failures) for </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">marketing 
                    purposes. Nobel Biocare has a long history of being unwilling to change 
                    materials, connections or surfaces, even in the face of mounting published 
                    evidence that changes were needed. Is this what you mean by "tried 
                    and true?" </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You also fail 
                    to list the three decades of implant fractures and the stripping of 
                    the hex with the weak, Grade 1 commercially pure titanium used in 
                    the Branemark implant as a possible 
                    disadvantage. Lekholm reported in his 20-year study (JOMI 1989) that, 
                    of the the Branemark 
                    implants followed for 15 years, 16% of the maxillary implants fractured. 
                    Dr. Stephen C.Eckert of Mayo Clinic reported 8% of the Branemark implants 
                    used in the posterior mandible fractured. Mel Schwartz said that 50% 
                    of his Branemark implants fractured when used in the lower posterior 
                    mandible (USC 1996 Symposium).</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the other 
                    hand, you do say that fractures of internal hex implants is a possible 
                    disadvantage. This is an unfair generalization since there are many 
                    diameter options available with internal connections. When the proper 
                    number and diameter of implants are used with a properly designed 
                    prosthesis, internal hex Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> implants are less 
                    likely to fracture than the Grade 1 and 3 commercially pure titanium 
                    external hex implants. This is well documented with comparisons of 
                    30-degree compression tests that are published on our website along 
                    with excerpts of a Binon article showing the stability of both our 
                    internal and external friction-fit connections:

                  <p align="left"> </p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You list Paragon's 
                    many options as both an advantage and disadvantage. One-dimensional 
                    implant lines, such as Innova's Endopore<sup>&reg;</sup>, which offers 
                    only one surface (beaded), one shape (tapered), one platform (external 
                    hex), one design (non-threaded) and one surgical protocol (two-stage), 
                    you list as having no disadvantages. Similarly, you list Steri-Oss 
                    advantage as having "lots of choices," but do not list this as also 
                    being a disadvantage, as you do with Paragon. In fact, the Steri-Oss 
                    System<sup>&reg;</sup> includes 6-7 different external hex platforms. 
                    It is no wonder their restorative catalog includes 149 abutment options 
                    for cemented restorations. Now that they are owned by Nobel Biocare, 
                    the combined product lines offer approximately 10 different platforms, 
                    none of which have cross compatibility. However, you do not see this 
                    as a disadvantage for either company! </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More recently, 
                    Nobel Biocare's introduction of the Steri-Oss Replace Select implant 
                    with an internal connection sparked patent litigation with Paragon. 
                    Nobel Biocare's ads say "What every dentist wants... an internal connection." 
                    I guess this means that they have been selling what every dentist 
                    doesn't want, an external hex implant! Apparently, even </font></p>

                    disagrees with you about the desirability of an external hex implant. 
                    Steri-Oss had to copy my patented design in order to meet the demands 
                    of discerning dentists. Even Nobel Biocare's Branemark line (Mk III 
                    and Mk IV) feature the Stargrip&#153; internal wrench-engaging design 
                    that infringe my patents. These implants no longer need to attach 
                    a fixture mount, because they have an internal, six-sided surface 
                    within the external hex extension. Core-Vent offered this feature 
                    dating back to 1982. Fixture mounts that can be used as transfers, 
                    temporary abutments and even final abutments, as offered in Paragon 
                    products, certainly offer advantages in time and cost savings that 
                    you apparently do not recognize. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paragon does 
                    offer many design options, but they target different markets, which 
                    eliminates potential confusion in implant selection. For example:</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Paragon 
                    makes an external hex implant, the Taper-Lock&#153;, which features 
                    a patented tapered external hex. To reduce product confusion, this 
                    implant is available in three diameters, but all share the same platform. 
                    Consequently, only one set of abutments, analogs, healing collars 
                    and transfers are needed. This implant system is targeted to the low-priced 
                    market ($124 with orders of 15 implants), and to those dentists still 
                    unwilling to change to better connections. Paragon's external hex 
                    is tapered to provide a friction-fit with the abutments, which is 
                    why Paragon can offer a 5-year guarantee against screw </font></p>

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Paragon 
                    offers the one- or two-stage Advent implant, which features a 3 mm-long 
                    neck extension that can be used as the abutment for screw-retained 
                    restorations. 3i and Steri-Oss advocate one-stage procedures, but 
                    then must sell you a healing collar to convert their two-stage implants.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Paragon 
                    offers several designs of two-stage implants with internal hexes that 
                    target specific preferences in surgical protocols. If one prefers 
                    a push-in implant, the Bio-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> cylinder and the Micro-Vent<sup>2</sup>&#153; 
                    ledge implant are available. The most popular design in our internal 
                    hex implant line is the Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup>, with a 14-year 
                    history on the market. A new version is just now becoming available 
                    that has the same tapered body and triple lead threads 
                    as the AdVent&#153; implant. This tapered design is inserted into 
                    a straight hole, which expands and compresses the bone for greater 
                    initial stability. </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Paragon 
                    now offers a clone of the Straumann synOcta<sup>&reg;</sup> implant

                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To simplify 
                    the selection process, Paragon offers a free, interactive click-to-chart

                    or she wants and select the surface, diameter and length options available 
                    for that system. The program then prompts the user through the selection 
                    of abutments, healing collars, transfers, analogs, drills, etc., specific 
                    for the selected implant design and platform. If you think options 
                    are a disadvantage, you certainly must not like Dell, Sony, Toshiba 
                    or any of the computer companies that allow customers to custom design 
                    their computers through an on-line ordering. They literally provide 
                    thousands of configurations to suit each customer's needs. Paragon

                    review of their system. You do acknowledge the inability to make a 
                    transfer impression as a disadvantage with conical connections -- 
                    and yet you claim "all of the root-form implants are created equal." 
                    Straumann certainly recognized this disadvantage and recently introduced 
                    its new internal octagon synOcta<sup>&reg;</sup> implant and abutment 
                    system in Europe. Although they now sell some sizes of this implant 
                    in the U.S., they have no abutments or transfers available. They have 
                    delayed the launch of this new prosthetic system in the U.S. due to 
                    current litigation for infringing my internal wrench-engaging patent. 
                    Paragon sells a full line of SwissPlus&#153; abutments and transfers 
                    that fit ITI<sup>&reg;</sup> synOcta implants. These abutments eliminate 
                    the esthetic limitations and complicated impression procedures caused 
                    by having the top of the ITI implant be the margin of the restoration.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You list In 
                    nova and Lifecore as having the "Greatest Surface Area of the Group." 
                    Although Innova advertises that its beads offer increased surface 
                    area, I doubt that this is true when compared to threaded implants 
                    with blasted surfaces. More importantly, very little of the surface 
                    of the beads make initial contact with bone to provide the optimum 
                    interface for osseointegration. 
                    When bone recedes, exposed beads may become a soft-tissue problem. 
                    This was documented in their early animal studies in which approximately 
                    50% of these implants failed in dogs due to infection. An unthreaded, 
                    tapered implant offers the least opportunity for the initial stability 
                    that is so important for osseointegration. This initial stability 
                    is absolutely vital for one-stage implants. Lifecore offers implants 
                    coated with TPS and blasted with tricalcium phosphate (RBM™ ;). Paragon 
                    offers these surfaces as well, but we have eliminated TPS on our newer 
                    implants because the blasted surface has been demonstrated in histological 
                    studies to provide an increased percentage of bone contact compared 
                    to TPS. Studies clearly show that blasted surfaces and HA-coated surfaces 
                    have a significantly higher percentage of bone contact than machined 
                    surfaces. You do not state your basis for claiming that there is no 
                    difference in clinical results with different implant surfaces. Straumann 
                    is switching from TPS to SLA (blasted and etched) due to soft tissue 
                    complications from TPS exposure.</font></p>

                    surface implants that are even smoother than the Branemark machined 
                    surface. 3i did offer an internal hex, small-diameter implant, which 
                    Lazzara, the president, described in a published article as being 
                    the best connection for small diameter implants. Following patent 
                    litigation, 3i developed a small diameter external hex implant to

                    Straumann has switched the design of its platform to a new design 
                    they call the synOcta<sup>&reg;</sup> implant. It takes the same Solid

                    patent, and both 3i and Lifecore have agreed in lawsuit settlements 
                    not to infringe. Today, only Paragon is making the clone of the new

                    Furthermore, Paragon's SwissPlus abutments and transfers fit Straumann's 
                    synOcta implants, which provide the prosthetic flexibility that Straumann 
                    promises in its website, but fails to deliver in the U.S. The SwissPlus 
                    is packaged with a fixture mount that engages the octagon and covers 
                    the external shoulder of the implant platform. This component is designed 
                    to be used as a transfer, and can be shortened for use as an abutment. 
                    In addition, the SwissPlus is packaged with a 2 mm Surgical Cover 
                    Screw. The SwissPlus implant, combination Fixture Mount/Transfer/ 
                    Abutment and 2mm Surgical Cover Screw together represent a 60% savings

                    but this requires extra time and is less accurate than traditional 
                    transfer techniques. It is necessitated by the design of the implant-abutment

                    While it may not affect success, subcrestal placement of the Bicon 
                    implant is an aberration of accepted implant placement protocol. It 
                    is necessitated by a need to address the esthetic limitations of Bicon's 
                    post-hole connection. Subcrestal placement is required in order to 
                    drop the abutment's height of contour as close to the crest of the 
                    ridge as possible. Implant-abutment connections that seal the outer 
                    periphery of the implant will allow the abutment's emergence profile 
                    to come directly off the implant, just as crowns of natural teeth 
                    come off of the roots. This implant design allows preparation of the 
                    margin down to the top of the implant for esthetics. There is no need 
                    to drop the implant below the crest, because the abutment's height 
                    of contour can be simply be lowered. </font></p>

                    Some people claim that you have to cut away crestal bone at the second-stage 
                    surgery with the Bicon implant. Why would you have to do that if you 
                    placed the implant correctly? </font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6">A:</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    There is a reason why Bicon makes ridge-contouring surgical instruments 
                    for use at the time of abutment placement. If you follow the manufacturer's 
                    directions, you will sink the implant 3-5mm below the crest of the 
                    ridge, then use the ridge-contouring tools to remove crestal bone 
                    at the second-stage surgery. This is done in order to allow seating 
                    of the abutment with its height of contour as close to the crest of 
                    the ridge as possible. If the abutment hits the crest of the ridge 
                    before it fully seats into the tapered hole of the implant, the necessary 
                    frictional connection between the components will not be achieved. 
                    By lowering the abutment's height of contour, the margins of the restoration 
                    can be placed subgingival with an allowance for subsequent soft tissue 
                    recession. This is a further attempt to overcome the hourglass emergence 
                    profile of the Bicon system. </font></p>

                    Of course, adding a healing cap to project through the tissue will 
                    maintain the opening during the healing period. However, communication 
                    from the top of the healing cap to 3-5mm below the crest of the ridge 
                    could contribute to bacterial infection, and an undercut could become 
                    a plaque trap. A true one-stage implant seals the crest of the ridge 
                    and has a neck extension on the implant that protrudes through the 
                    tissue. The implant-abutment junction is also above the crest, which 
                    is certainly better than below the crest of the ridge, as with Bicon.</font></p>

                    around since the late 1970s and there is a good reason it has never 
                    really been very popular. Give yourself a break and try a system that 
                    more closely replicates a missing tooth. That will allow direct or 
                    indirect preparation of the abutments with placement of subgingival 
                    margins, regardless of subsequent gingival recession. Also, try a 
                    true one-stage system, such as Paragon's Swiss-Plus™ ; that comes 
                    with a fixture mount that also serves as the transfer and as a preparable 
                    abutment. Implant dentistry doesn't get much simpler or economical

                    how to use. THE QUESTION IS: HOW MANY COMPROMISES ARE YOU WILLING

                    specialists who want to build their implant practices are now attaching 
                    the abutments for their restorative dentists. Others are providing 
                    the GPs with the restorative components. This saves the GP from having 
                    to read a 100-page catalog to find the correct emergence profile transfer 
                    and abutment. Even if the restorative dentist is knowledgeable in 
                    implant reconstruction, the cost of the components impacts the GP’s 
                    profitability and ultimately effects the number of cases the dentist 
                    will send you. For these reasons, the cost and complexity of the restorative 
                    components should be considered by the surgical specialist when selecting 
                    an implant system.</font></p>
                  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Attaching 
                    the abutment by the surgeon at the second-stage surgery eliminates 
                    the cost of buying a healing collar and saves the restorative dentist 
                    both chair time and abutment expense. The restorative dentist will 
                    now only need to complete the preparation intra-orally and make a 
                    conventional impression. The Taper-Lock’s fixture mount is designed 
                    for use as a transfer, which facilitates stage-one transfer impressions 
                    by the surgeon in the esthetic zone. This will allow the indirect 
                    preparation of an abutment and fabrication of the temporary restoration 
                    for attachment at second-stage surgery. This saves the cost of transfer 
                    transfer components and healing collars while establishing the ideal 
                    emergence profile healing of the soft tissue. The fixture mount of 
                    the Taper-Lock implant is slightly tapered so that it can be shortened 
                    for use as a temporary abutment. The fixture mount on the SwissPlus 
                    is designed not only for use as a transfer, but also as the final 
                    preparable abutment. <b>Cost savings with Paragon products comes from

                    and others clearly show that it relatively smooth. Paragon’s website 
                    posts side-by-side SEMs of the machined neck of the Osseotite and 
                    its acid-etched body, which demonstrates that the acid-etched Osseotite

                    with and without their surfaces. Straumann’s claims are supported 
                    by animal studies that either make the comparison to a machined surfaces, 
                    or show no statistical difference with TPS surfaces. 3i supports its 
                    claims by citing animal studies, most of which were not even conducted 
                    on the Osseotite surface. The published research from many sources 
                    confirms that HA coatings offer stronger and faster bone attachment. 
                    Two recent studies, however, showed that Paragon’s SBM-blasted surface
