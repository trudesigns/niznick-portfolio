                this action alleging products liability and dental malpractice, defendants 
                Nobel Biocare AB d/b/a Nobelpharma AB and Nobel Biocare USA, Inc. d/b/a 
                Nobelpharma U.S.A., Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Nobelpharma”) 
                move for summary judgement on the grounds that some of plaintiff’s claims 
                are untimely and that the others contain no triable issues of fact. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; On July 15, 1988, plaintiff, Judith Hochman, first consulted 
                Dr. Tarnow, a dentist, regarding the possibility of using dental implants 
                to replace missing teeth on the bottom right side of her jaw. Dr. Tarnow 
                examined plaintiff and evaluated her physical condition. Based on this 
                examination and evaluation, he formulated an initial plan to put implants 
                and a fixed bridge into the bottom right side of plaintiff’s jaw. Subsequently, 
                plaintiff lost and broke teeth on the bottom left side of her mouth that 
                also required implants. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff received implants, referred to as “Branemark System” 
                implants. Nobelpharma manufactured and distributed the implant s to dental 
                professionals. Dr. Tarnow testified that he implant the Branemark implants 
                into the plaintiff’s jaw as follows: <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) On July 
                27, 1988, Dr. Tarnow placed three implants in plaintiff’s lower right 
                jaw. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) On September 
                1, 1988, Dr. Tarnow placed two implants in plaintiff’s lower left jaw. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) On December 
                15, 1989, Dr. Tarnow placed another implant in plaintiff’s lower right 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; second bicuspid 
                area.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) On December 
                14, 1991, Dr. Tarnow implanted two additional implants in the rear of 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; plaintiff’s lower 
                right side jaw. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) On January 
                5, 1994, he put an additional implant into the lower left of plaintiff’s 
                jaw.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Intermittently, throughout the relevant period, Dr. Tarnow 
                had to either tighten or replace several of the screws holding plaintiff’s 
                implants. In addition to the problems with the screws, some of plaintiff’s 
                implants fractured. Dr. Tarnow testified that the fractures occurred as 
                follows:<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) On or about 
                October 16, 1989, Dr. Tarnow discovered that the middle implant on the 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower right side 
                of plaintiff’s jaw had fractured. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) On or about 
                March 12, 1993, plaintiff fractured the interior implant on the lower 
                right <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; side of her jaw. 
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Co-defendant 
                dentists noted an additional implant fracture during plaintiff’s visit 
                on <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; June 2, 1994. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) An x-ray 
                taken on July 13, 1994, showed an additional fracture in one of the implants. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff claims that during the relevant time period, have 
                suffered seven fractures in a total of ten implants implanted in her lower 
                jaw, but she does not specify the dates of the implants or the dates that 
                the fractures occurred. (Pltf. Aff. in Op- p.5) <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In June, 1994, co-defendant dentists advised plaintiff that 
                she would need a partial removable denture because she no longer had adequate 
                implants to support a fixed bridge. Plaintiff’s last visit to the co-defendant 
                dentists was on July 21, 1994. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Plaintiff commenced this action on May 9, 1995. The complaint 
                states four causes of action against Nobelpharma: negligent design and 
                manufacture and failure to warn; breach of warranty; strict products liability 
                and fraud. Plaintiff claims, inter alia, that the implants fractured because 
                Nobelpharma manufactured them from an inferior grade of titanium and that 
                Nobelpharma failed to warn of the problems involved in implanting the 
                Branemark System implants into partially edentulous patients.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defendant contends that plaintiff’s own unique physiology, 
                (she is described as a “bruxer” with a powerful bite), not a manufacturing 
                defect, caused the implants to fracture. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In support of the motion for summary judgement, Nobelpharma 
                argues: a) that certain of plaintiff’s claims are barred by the applicable 
                statues of limitations; b) that plaintiff’s negligence claim must be dismissed 
                because Nobelpharma exercised reasonable care in the manufacture and design 
                of the Branemark implants; c) the strict liability claim must be dismissed 
                because plaintiff cannot establish that a defect in the Branemark implants 
                proximately caused her injuries; d) that Nobelpharma provided adequate 
                warnings regarding the dangers of the implants; e) that the breach of 
                warranty claim must be dismissed because the Branemark implants were reasonably 
                fit for their intended purpose; and f) that plaintiff’s allegations of 
                fraud are inadequate to sustain a cause of action for fraud or misrepresentation.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In opposition to the motion, plaintiff argues, inter alia, 
                that summary judgment must be denied because Nobelpharma has failed to 
                make a prima facie showing that it is entitled to judgment as a matter 
                of law. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; A. <u>Negligence and Strict Liability</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The three year statue of limitations for personal injury 
                caused by the malfunction of a prosthesis implanted or inserted into the 
                plaintiff’s body begins to run from the date of the injury caused by the 
                malfunction, not the date of implantation. <i>Martin v. Edwards Laboratories, 
                Div. of American Hospital Supply Corp., 60 N.Y.2d 417</i>. Upon a motion 
                to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds, plaintiff bears the burden 
                of coming forward with some evidence that the injury occurred less than 
                three years before the suit. Here, Nobelpharma has established, through 
                Dr. Tarnow’s testimony that the fractures occurred in October 1989, March 
                1993, June 1993 and July 1994. Plaintiff has offered no evidence to rebut 
                this information. Because this action was commenced on May 9, 1995, plaintiff’s 
                claims of negligence and strict liability regarding the October 1989 fracture 
                are time barred because that fracture occurred more than three years before 
                the commencement of this action.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. <u>Breach of Warranty</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statue of limitations for plaintiff’s breach of 
                warranty claim is four years measured from Nobelpharma’s tender of delivery 
                of the Branemark implants to the co-defendant dentists. UCC Section 2-725; 
                <i>Heller v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp.,</i> 64 N.Y.2d 407. In this case, 
                the exact date of tender of delivery of each of the implants is impossible 
                to establish. Accordingly, the court will look to the day before implantation 
                of each of the implants as the latest date that tender could have occurred. 
                Accordingly, plaintiff’s breach of warranty claims for the implants that 
                occurred on July 27, 1988, September 1, 1988 and December 15, 1989 are 
                time barred because tender occurred more than four years before the commencement 
                of this action.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; <u>SUMMARY JUDGMENT</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; A. <u>Negligence and Strict Products Liability</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well settled that on a motion for summary judgement, 
                the proponent of the motion must make a prima facie showing of entitlement 
                to judgment as a matter of law, tendering sufficient evidence to demonstrate 
                the absence of any material issue of fact. <i>Alvarez v. Prospect Hospital,</i> 
                68 N.Y.2d. 320; <i>Winegrad v. New Your University Med. Center,</i> 64 
                N.Y.2d 851. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; As to those portions of plaintiff’s negligence and strict 
                liability claims alleging that the implants fractured because they were 
                manufactured with an inferior grade of titanium, Nobelpharma has failed 
                to come forward with a scintilla of evidence to rebut the allegations 
                of negligent design and manufacture. Therefore, as to those claims, Nobelpharma 
                has failed to make a prima facie showing that it is entitled to judgement 
                as a matter of law. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; However, as to those portions of the negligence and strict 
                liability claims alleging failure to warn1, Nobelpharma has, in its reply 
                papers, included several excerpts, that it authored, from brochures and 
                textbooks, circa 1985, that discuss the risks of fractures from mechanical 
                forces. These articles are sufficient to establish Nobelpharma’s prima 
                facie case on this portion of its summary judgment motion.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, plaintiff submits the deposition testimony 
                of Dr. Bo Rangert, the director of clinical research for Nobelpharma, 
                in which Dr. Rangert states that, in 1988, the use of implants in partially 
                edentulous patients was experimental. Plaintiff also submits the deposition 
                testimony of Dr. Dennis Tarnow, the dentist who performed the implantations 
                into plaintiff’s mouth. Dr. Tarnow testified that, prior to July, 1988, 
                the start of plaintiff’s treatment, no representative from Nobelpharma 
                advised him that the use of the Branemark implant system in partially 
                edentulous patients was experimental. Moreover, he testified that it was 
                not until 1994 to ‘95 or ‘96 that Nobelpharma advised him that, in partially 
                edentulous patients, there was an increased risk of implant fracture with 
                using implants in a straight line configuration in the molar region of 
                the mouth. (Tarnow Dep, Def. Ex. C, p. 315) <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, plaintiff submits the affidavit of its expert, 
                Dr. Gerald Niznick, in which Dr. Niznick opines that both the use of grade 
                one titanium and implantation in a straight line configuration are contributing 
                factors in the fracture rate when Branemark implants are used for partially 
                edentulous patients. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; A manufacturer who places a defective product on the market 
                that causes injury may be liable for the ensuing injuries. <i>Liriano 
                v. Hobart, Corp.</i> 92 N.Y.2d 232, <i>Codling v. Paglia,</i> 32 NY2d 
                330. A product may be defective when it contains a manufacturing flaw, 
                is defectively designed or is not accompanied by adequate warnings for 
                the use of the product. <i>Liriano v. Hobart, Corp., supra; Codling v. 
                Paglia, supra.</i> A manufacturer has a duty to warn against latent dangers 
                resulting from forseeable uses of its product of which it knew or should 
                have known. <i>Rastelli v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</i> 79 NY2d 850. 
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Warnings for commodities such as dental implants are intended 
                for the dentist or oral surgeon whose duty it is to balance the risks 
                and benefits of using implants and of the various implant systems available. 
                The dentist or oral surgeon acts as the “informed intermediary” (See, 
                <i>Martin v. Hacker,</i> 83NY2d 1; <i>Wolfgruber v. Upjohn Co,</i> 72 
                AD2d 59, <i>aff’d</i> 52 NY2d 768) between the manufacturer and the patient 
                and, thus, the manufacturer’s duty to caution against risks involved in 
                using the product is fulfilled by giving adequate warning through the 
                dentist or oral surgeon, not directly to the patient. (See, <i>Wolfgruber 
                v. Upjohn, Co., supra</i>). the warning must provide sufficient information 
                to that category of prescribing dentists who may be expected to have the 
                least knowledge and experience with the implant. (See, <i>Martin v. Hacker, 
                supra; Lindsay v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., 6327 F. 2d 87 [2d Ctr. 1980]</i>)<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The adequacy of the instruction or warning is generally 
                a question of fact to be determined at trial...and is not ordinarily susceptible 
                to the drastic remedy of summary judgment.” <i>Bukowski v. Coopervision, 
                Inc.,</i> 185 AD2d 31; <i>Johnson v. Johnson Chem. Co.,</i> 183 AD2d 64. 
                The factors to be considered in resolving this question include whether 
                the warning was clear, accurate and consistent and whether it portrays 
                with sufficient intensity the risk involved in using the product. See, 
                <i>martin v. Hacker, supra.</i> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; Here, Dr. Tarnow contends that he did not receive warning 
                material from Nobelpharma regarding the use of the Branemark implants 
                in partially edentulous patients until at least 1994. However, Nobelpharma 
                argues that the material was available and included in textbooks in 1985. 
                Accordingly, it is for the jury to decide whether Nobelpharma adequately 
                warned dentists regarding the use of Branemark implants in partially edentulous 
                patients. <br>
                <br>
                C. <u>Fraud and Misrepresentation</u> <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courts in this state do not recognize a separate 
                cause action based on fraud for a manufacturer’s failure to disclose that 
                the product was not suited for its intended use unless the misconduct 
                complained of in the fraud cause of action is different from the conduct 
                complained of in the manufacture and marketing of the product. <u>New 
                York Pattern Jury Instructions</u>, Vol. 1A, Section 2;120, p. 567 (2000). 
                <i>See. New York Seven-Up Bottling Col, v. Dow,</i> 96 A.D.2d 1051, <i>aff’d</i> 
                61 N.Y.2d 828 (where the allegations of fraud are only incidental to another 
                cause of action, the fraud statute of limitations can not be invoked). 
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; In her cause of action for fraud, plaintiff alleges that 
                Nobelpharma made false representations that the Branemark implants were 
                safe and effective for their intended use and that Nobelpharma concealed 
                that the implants were prone to fracture. The fraud complained of here 
                is merely incidental to plaintiff’s claims of strict liability, negligence 
                and breach of warranty. Plaintiff’s fraud cause of action does not identify 
                conduct by Nobelpharma that is different from the conduct alleged in the 
                other causes of action. Nor does plaintiff claim that her damages based 
                on the fraud are different from the damages she has claimed based on the 
                other causes of action. Accordingly, plaintiff’s fourth cause of action 
                sounding in fraud and misrepresentation is dismissed. Accordingly, defendant 
                Nobelpharma’s motion for summary judgment is granted to the extent that 
                plaintiff’s fourth cause of action for fraud against Nobelpharma is dismissed.<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, plaintiff’s claims of negligence and strict 
                liability as to the October 1989 fracture are dismissed as time barred 
                and plaintiff’s breach of warranty claims for the implants that occurred 
                on July 27, 1988, September 1, 1988 and December 15, 1989 are time barred. 
                in all other respects defendant Nobelpharma’s motion for summary judgment 
                is denied. The complaint is deemed amended accordingly. <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; The foregoing is the decision and order of the court. Copies
