                  I have an implant with cracked internal hex. What is the best way to 
                  remove it? Should I use a trephine-drill (where can I get one ?) or

                1990, we began offering the Screw-Vent implant in both commercially pure 
                titanium and titanium alloy. Six years later, we widened the neck of the 
                small-diameter Screw-Vent from 3.5mmD to 3.7mmD, which required the incorporation 
                of a countersink section at the top of each length-specific drill. Core-Vent/Paragon 
                has also have offered wide-diameter, internally threaded implants with 
                4.5mmD necks since 1986. To date, we have not received a single fracture 
                report with these wide-diameter implants. To maximize strength, Paragon 
                has offered all diameters of the Screw-Vent implant only in titanium alloy 
                since 1997. The following guidelines are provided in Paragon's product

                <b>Additional Comment from Dr. Murray L. Arlin:</b> Paragon Implant Company 
                has a self-tapping tool that threads into the implant in a counterclockwise 
                direction. Once the tool bottoms out inside the implant, continued turning 
                counterclockwise under applied force will break the osseointegration and 
                unscrew the implant from the jaw. I recently did this with a Screw-Vent 
                where there was a lost cemented abutment. I cleaned out the cement within 
                the implant with a bur, and the removal tool cut through the residual 
                cement and grabbed into the titanium inner walls of the implant.<br>
                <br>
                I have had 6 internal hex implants that experienced "hex splits" out of 
                600 placed over the last 5 to 13 years. They occurred within a 1- to 3-year 
                period after the prosthetic restoration. All cases were full-arch, fixed 
                restorations incorporating 6 implants with a 10 to 12 mm cantilever. Five 
                of the 6 hex splits were at the terminal implant location, while in one 
                case the 2 terminal implants on the same side split. None of the implants 
                were wide diameter and none occurred on any implants manufactured after 
                1996 when the walls were increased by 2/10ths of a mm.<br>

                  I attended a course given by the guys of BioHorizons. They say that 
                  they have found that the initial crestal resorption during the first 
                  year in dental implants is related to the design of the neck of the 
                  implant. I asked what role bacteria plays in that phenomenon, and they 
                  said NONE. I am not very convinced with that answer. What do you think 
                  about the presence of bacteria in the implant-abutment interface or 
                  design of the neck of the implant as the cause of initial crestal bone 
                  resorption?<br>

                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To the question of whether 
                  the presence of bacteria in the implant-abutment interface or the neck 
                  design of the implant is the main cause of crestal bone loss, the answer 
                  is most likely NEITHER.<br>
                  <br>
                  Crestal bone loss is initially related to how thick the labial plate 
                  is at the time of implant placement. Long-term, it is determined by 
                  the intensity and/or the direction of the load on the implant. Yes, 
                  bacteria from wobbly implant/abutment joints can contribute to bone 
                  loss, as Citron has shown. However, bone loss also occurs with the ITI 
                  implant, which has no joint connection near the crest of the bone. As 
                  for implant design, implants with wider necks, and which often requiring 
                  countersinking, can also contribute to bone loss because of the stress 
                  concentration at the crest. Carl Misch and I lectured in Venezuela several 
                  years ago and he revealed his secret for eliminating radiographic bone 
                  loss with the BioHorizons implant. In the maxilla, he inserts the implant 
                  several millimeters below the crest and then waits for bone loss to 
                  occur --- before taking the xray. The bone loss occurs anyway, but it 
                  looks like the implant is level with the crest on the xray. There is 
                  nothing about the design of his implant that should or will reduce the 
                  amount of crestal bone loss any more than any other implant. This is 
                  unfortunately the only marketing story Carl and BioHorizons can come 
                  up to differentiate their implant from competitors...and it is a bogus.

                  I am sorry to bother you with a personal e-mail like this but I need 
                  some help. I am treatment planning a large restorative case with Advent 
                  implants. Basically the patient is edentulous in the mandible and I 
                  will be restoring her with a hybrid prosthesis using 6 implants. I looked 
                  through your CD ROM but it does not discuss this type of restoration. 
                  I plan on using Advent as a one-stage procedure with an interim denture 
                  while she heals. What abutment is best, in your opinion, to restore 
                  this type of case? I have done cases like this with Lifecore and Astra 
                  but I want to use Paragon products now. Thanks for any information.<br>

                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I checked Paragon's CD-ROM 
                  900-slide series and the complete step-by-step clinical and laboratory 
                  procedures are there for screw-retained dentures. Just click onto "restorative 
                  manual" on page one, and then onto "bar overdentures." Begin advancing 
                  through the web pages from there and you will see the ACT abutment, 
                  how it is used to make bars, and then a lot on screw-retained dentures. 
                  In addition, on Paragon's website, which is also on the CD-ROM, go to 
                  the download page and click on Abutment Selection Guide and you will

                  Basically you have two choices ... one is to just attach a gold cylinder 
                  (or plastic cylinder) to the analog of the top of the Advent and wax 
                  up your framework. Preferably, just attach the ACT screw for the Advent 
                  and convert it to an ACT abutment, which has the advantage of having 
                  a shorter fixation screw than if you connected directly to the implant. 
                  Once you have attached the ACT screw, just take an abutment-level transfer, 
                  as if you were doing a bar case. With the Advent, the Implant Extender 
                  can be used with the ACT screw for more height.<br>

                  I tried using the Tapered Screw-Vent for a sinus elevation procedure, 
                  but could not completely seat the implant, even with a mallet. Since 
                  then, I have used the Micro-Vent implant, then the Micro-Vent2 implant 
                  for many years and have been very happy with it. Recently someone mentioned 
                  that the Micro-Vent2 is going to be discontinued. Is this true?<br>

                  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for your long-term 
                  support. First, we will be making the tapered Micro-Vent2 for well into 
                  2002. Let me correct some misconceptions that you may have about this 
                  implant and the Tapered Screw-Vent. The Tapered Screw-Vent does not 
                  even have a bone tap made for it, nor is it tapped in with a mallet 
                  like the Micro-Vent2. Second, the Tapered Screw-Vent will provide far 
                  greater initial stability than the Micro-Vent2 because it is threaded 
                  over its entire surface and will expand/compress soft bone if you insert 
                  it into a socket prepared with the intermediate drill (i.e. stop at 
                  the 2.8mmD drill for the 3.7mmD implant or the 3.8mmD drill for the 
                  4.7mmD implant). If you had problems trying to fully seat the implant, 
                  you were most likely trying to elevate the floor of the sinus as you 
                  threaded the implant in, thinking that it would lift the floor of the 
                  sinus. If you were not through the cortical bone surrounding the sinus, 
                  the round end of the Tapered Screw-Vent would stop on the cortical shell 
                  around the sinus, with the risk of stripping the threads in the bone. 
                  You should drill slowly through the floor of the sinus or tap it up 
                  with an osteotome, and then seat the implant as you tent up the membrane. 
                  You have been successful with Micro-Vent2 because of its HA coating 
                  as much as its design. The tapered Screw-Vent will allow you to load 
                  earlier in soft bone and to make stage-one transfer impressions because 
                  of its better initial stability.</font></p>

                  expecting you to "make a wholesale switch from ITI to anything else" 
                  and can certainly appreciate that this is "because they work better

                  the ITI to the Friadent and 3i, not to the SwissPlus or Tapered SwissPlus. 
                  That is the point ...you recognize the advantages of these implants 
                  and should be able to conclude that they will solve many of the limitations

                  You are obviously not adverse to trying new things...you switched from 
                  TPS to SLA. The only thing Straumann has shown with SLA is that it has 
                  a little higher percentage of bone attachment than TPS. The Buser et 
                  al. study (J Biomed Mat Res 1991;25:889-902) reported the difference 
                  as not being statistically significant. We have three independent studies 
                  showing Paragon's SBM surface has higher percentage of bone contact 
                  than TPS (one Belgium study compared SBM to ITI's TPS) and two of the 
                  studies showed that SBM even have a higher percentage of bone contact 
                  than HA (Louisiana State University). Check out these studies, if surface 
                  is what is important to you:<br>

                  sleeve...held in place without overlapping the analog undercut that 
                  then requires cutting back of the margins.<br>
                  <br>
                  2. Increased initial stability-The tapered design will expand or compress 
                  soft bone, and the self-tapping design will simplify insertion and further 
                  enhance initial stability.<br>
                  <br>
                  3. Increased strength-The narrow tapered SwissPlus can withstand 100 
                  lbs more compression at 30 degrees than the ITI narrow 3.3mmD implants.<br>
                  <br>
                  4. Increased surface area-The double lead threads of the Tapered SwissPlus 
                  speed insertion, reduce insertion torque and increase surface area by 
                  34% along with the deeper coronal threads of the 4.8mmD Tapered SwissPlus.<br>
                  <br>
                  5. Bettor oral hygiene-With the full-contour, preparable abutments, 
                  the margin of the restoration can follow the contour of the tissue, 
                  eliminating deep subgingival cemented margins that often result from 
                  using the level shoulder of the implant as the margin. <br>
                  <br>
                  6. Cost savings to both you and your restorative dentists. For simple 
                  posterior restorations, the fixture mount becomes the full-contour abutment. 
                  Simply cut off the top square used for insertion and you have an emergence 
                  profile abutment that will shape the soft tissue. This will eliminate 
                  the need to cement a plastic protective cap on a narrow solid abutment. 
                  Furthermore, this "normal" type of implant abutment allows intraoral 
                  preparation of the margins, followed by conventional impression procedures 
                  (or use the fixture mount as the transfer and prep it on the working 
                  cast). You will not only save a substantial amount of money for yourself 
                  as you are buy and attach the abutments, but you will also save your 
                  restorative dentists considerable money when they need an angled or 
                  custom-cast abutment. <br>
                  <br>
                  In any case, our narrow abutments are less than half the price of Straumann's 
                  abutments, so you should consider ordering them for your Straumann implants. 
                  For you to focus on only the surface, and then to rely on your belief 
                  in the ITI researchers rather than on the validity and significance 
                  of the studies themselves is something that I would not have expected 
                  from a knowledgeable periodontist. Furthermore, surface consideration 
                  is but one factor in optimizing clinical success. Once you have two 
                  implants with the same degree of surface roughness (ITI and Paragon), 
                  both with research studies showing a high degree of bone attachment, 
                  then you need to look at other factors, such as I have described above. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  ITI is a mediocre implant, at best, both in quality of manufacturing 
                  and in design-even with their addition of my patented internal connection, 
                  which they are not fully utilizing. The minimum thread surface, due 
                  to the shallowness and roundness of the threads and narrow distance 
                  between threads makes predictable osseointegration in soft bone questionable. 
                  Certainly, from an early loading standpoint, it is greatly lacking in 
                  both surface area and initial stability compared to the Tapered SwissPlus 
                  implant.<br>
                  <br>
                  You state that you do not want to change your referral patterns, but 
                  yet you will have to change from the Friadent and 3i products to something 
                  to assure clinical success. Why don't you convert these referrals to 
                  the Tapered SwissPlus? This will give you the comfort of using something 
                  closer to the ITI concept and give them the prosthetics they are more 
                  familiar with by using full contour abutments. At the very least, to 
                  avoid fractures of their narrow implants, you should be using our narrow 
                  platform Tapered SwissPlus implant with a platform that more closely 
                  matches that of the ITI standard 4.8 mm platform than their narrow platform 
                  with the 1.6 mm high external octagon. <br>
                  <br>
                  Finally, you state that the "prosthetic problems are resolvable using 
                  a little ingenuity." They are completely resolvable by just changing 
                  systems. You cannot handhold every restorative dentist, especially the 
                  new ones you hope to enlist. Some of the problems are not that easily 
                  resolved. For example, when I was in Florida last time, one dentist 
                  told me that he had used ITI's plastic castable sleeves that overlap 
                  the undercut of the analog. This is how they gain stability during waxing. 
                  He said that when he went to dress down the gold flash created by these 
                  overextended plastic sleeves, he ruined the restoration. Would you want 
                  crowns in your mouth that had been overwaxed and required the technician 
                  or dentist to dress back the gold flash to guess where the margins should 
                  be? I think you should be leading your restorative dentists to better 
                  clinical results, simpler restorative procedures, more esthetic options 
                  and increased profits if you want to further expand your implant practice.<br>
                  <br>
                  Use your success as a springboard, not as a pedestal. Do not be manipulated 
                  by ITI's marketing and assurances that, if you use this Swiss system, 
                  it will give you more credibility with your restorative dentists. They 
                  have effectively used this marketing strategy, buying opinion leaders 
                  to lead other professionals to their products. This is the reason they 
                  are selling at 80 times earnings. They make enough high profits from 
                  the followers to pay their opinion leaders. Nobel Biocare used the same 
                  type of marketing strategy for years until they finally had to buy an 
                  American company to survive in this country.<br>
                  <br>
                  THAT IS ALL THE WISDOM AND ADVICE I CAN GIVE YOU. THE REST IS UP TO 
                  YOU. </font></p>

                  Sargon may be compacting bone when dentists first expand the pods. However, 
                  if the implant/bone interface turns into fibrous tissue, as happens 
                  when osseointegration is not achieved, the amount of bone lost could 
                  be highly variable, depending on the load and the time the nonintegrated 
                  implant was left in function. Just how fast IS the downgrowth of fibrous 
                  tissue? Could membranes help?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A:</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  I don't think that fibrous tissue necessarily has to grow downward. 
                  Bone is calcified fibrous tissue that forms in definite patterns, depending 
                  on stress and probably chemical messengers. I think fibrous tissue may 
                  occur through stresses, micromovements, etc., that break down the bone. 
                  In turn, the bone is "repaired" by replacement with fibrous scar tissue. 
                  If that is the case, a membrane probably wouldn't work.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I agree completely that downgrowth 
                  of soft tissue is not the issue. Let’s get down to basics. Osseointegration 
                  is dependent on the following three factors:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Avoid overheating when 
                  preparing bone.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Achieve initial stability. 
                  This can be accomplished with a self-tapping thread or, better yet, 
                  a tapered, self-tapping implant, screwed into a straight hole for bone 
                  expansion. You don't need expanding pods to accomplish this.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Avoid premature loading. 
                  The variables of bone density, initial stability, surface roughness, 
                  force and direction of initial loading of the implant affects osseointegration 
                  success if the implant is not submerged. This is especially true if 
                  the implant is immediately loaded. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I think that initial stability 
                  and, therefore, the likelihood of success with immediate loading, can 
                  be more predictably and effectively achieved with a rough surface (better 
                  yet HA surface) on a self-tapping tapered implant, than with expanding 
                  pods. If the Sargon idea is that the pods allow you to read the bone 
                  and you should only immediately load if the bone is so dense that the 
                  pods can't expand, one can determine the density of the bone for immediate 
                  loading based on the resistance to drilling or self-tapping. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Sargon claim of being 
                  able to expand the pods to get a second chance at osseointegration is 
                  a false claim. The likelihood of achieving success the first time is 
                  probably greater if the surface is rougher, the design of the implant 
                  allows self-tapping, and especially if the bone is expanded. Sargon 
                  has a smooth machined surface and is not self-tapping. One can always 
                  just replace the failed implant with a wider one if osseointegration 
                  is lost on an immediately loaded solid implant, and then wait for non-loaded 
                  healing. With Sargon, one is going to have to remove the crown to expand 
                  the pods and then leave it off to avoid further loading. This is just 
                  as much a nuisance as replacing the implant, especially if the better 
                  surface and self-tapping design can increase the initial stability and, 
                  therefore, the likelihood of integration in the first place. </font></p>

                  titanium implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched (SLA) surface in 
                  the maxilla of miniature pigs. The two best-documented surfaces in implant 
                  dentistry, the machined and the titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) surfaces 
                  served as controls. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks of healing, removal torque 
                  testing was performed to evaluate the interface shear strength of each 
                  implant type. The results revealed statistically significant differences 
                  between the machined and the two rough titanium surfaces (p &lt;. 00001). 
                  The machined surface demonstrated mean removal torque values (RTV) between 
                  0.13 and 0.26 Nm, whereas the RTV of the two rough surfaces ranged between 
                  1.14 and 1.56 Nm. At 4 weeks of healing, the SLA implants yielded a 
                  higher mean RTV than the TPS implants (1.39 vs. 1.14 Nm) without reaching 
                  statistical significance. At 8 and 12 weeks of healing, the two rough 
                  surfaces showed similar mean RTVs. The implant position also had a significant 
                  influence on removal torque for each implant type primarily owing to 
                  differences in density in the per implant bone structure. It can be 
                  concluded that the interface shear strength of titanium implants is 
                  significantly influenced by their surface characteristics, since the 
                  machined titanium surface demonstrated significantly lower RTV in the

                  more and more implant companies have developed systems that promise

                  implants in the symphysis, splinted and loaded immediately. Babbush 
                  and Kent published on several thousand implants restored this way. It 
                  is rapidly becoming accepted methodology again to immediately load implants 
                  that are splinted across the midline in edentulous jaws. Schnitman published 
                  a 10-year study of Branemark implants immediately loaded. Here he loaded

                  Tarnow of NYU published on immediate loading in both arches. I am presently 
                  funding an immediate loading study of one-piece, one-stage ADVENT implants 
                  at New York University and University of Pittsburgh. The protocol calls 
                  for the placement of 4 implants in the symphysis, two of which are blasted 
                  and two are HA coated. Immediately upon suturing, a gold collar, shaped 
                  like the collar of a standard two-piece abutment, will be attached to 
                  the top of the implant. These gold collars are then joined in the mouth 
                  with gold dolder bars cut to length and attached with autopolymerizing 
                  acrylic. The assembly is then removed, soldered and returned for attachment 
                  to the implants within 24 hours. An overdenture will then be attached. 
                  This splints the one-stage implants for greater stability, saves the 
                  cost of transfers, analogs and the inaccuracy of indirect fabrication 
                  of bars. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you wanted to make a screw-retained 
                  temporary bridge to splint the implants immediately, a titanium sleeve 
                  could be attached to the top of each implant and the provisional prosthesis 
                  could be fabricated by using an omnivac shell made from the patient's 
                  old denture. The provisional prosthesis could then be relieved to accommodate 
                  the titanium, and relined directly in the mouth to incorporate the sleeves. 
                  A better way may be to do a transfer impression immediately upon inserting 
                  the implants and fabricate the temporary bridge indirectly. I know a 
                  number of dentists who use this method for unilateral bridges in the 
                  lower jaw where bone quality is good, but there is very little documentation 
                  to support this concept yet. I believe it will prove to be reliable 
                  with at least 3 implants splinted and kept out of full occlusion. The 
                  key to immediate loading is good quality bone and/or splinting around 
                  the arch. </font></p>

                  one minute in bone is sufficient to cause tissue injury. The extreme

                  Paragon has advocated intraoral abutment preparation without incident 
                  since 1981, provided an intermittent cutting technique with diamond 
                  burs under copious irrigation is utilized. A pilot thermographic analysis 
                  conducted by McCullagh et al. (Pract Period Aesthetic Dent 1998;10[9]) 
                  found that non-irrigated, high-speed preparation of five different abutment 
                  types with a medium-grit diamond burs in 60-second durations produced 
                  temperature increases that ranged from 13.2 to 31.3 degrees C. In contrast, 
                  Gross et al. (Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 1995;10[2]:207-212) compared 
                  heat generation at the implant surface during abutment preparation with 
                  tungsten carbide and diamond burs in a high-speed, turbine handpiece 
                  with standard turbine coolant. Cutting in 15-second increments reduced 
                  heat generation by 75% compared to continuous cutting for 30 seconds. 
                  During periods of continuous cutting for 30 seconds, tungsten carbide 
                  burs caused a mean temperature increase of 2 degrees C (maximum = 4.7 
                  degrees C), versus 1 degree C (maximum = less than 2 degrees) for diamond 
                  burs caused a mean temperature increase. Gross et al. conclude that 
                  abutment reduction with medium-grit diamond burs using intermittent 
                  pressure and normal turbine coolant is unlikely to cause an interface-temperature 
                  increase sufficient to cause irreversible bone damage and compromise 
                  osseointegration.</font></p>

                  </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The biological width 
                  seems to be an important factor in implant dentistry. What is your opinion 
                  on this subject?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5"><b>A: </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                  don't believe that "biological width" is a factor in implant dentistry. 
                  Dr. Dennis Tarnow, who is the greatest proponent of this concept, observed 
                  bone loss around two-stage Branemark<sup>&reg;</sup> implants and surmised 
                  that several millimeters of bone loss was inevitable below the junction 
                  of the implant and the abutment. This theory excluded the more likely 
                  scenario that stress under the wider 4mmD neck of the 3.7mmD Branemark 
                  implant was a source of stress concentration that resulted in bone loss. 
                  This is what Branemark's 1977 textbook concluded (Branemark P-I, Hansson 
                  BO, Adell R, et al. Osseointegrated Implants in <i>the Treatment of 
                  the Edentulous Jaw. Experience from a 10-year Period</i>. Stockholm, 
                  Sweden: Almqvust &amp; Wiskell International, 1977:110). </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another possibility is that 
                  the countersinking needed to place this implant also contributed to 
                  the bone loss. With the countersink drill separate from the final sizing 
                  drill, two possibilities exist. One is that, during seating, the implant 
                  bottoms out on the base of the countersink, rather than at the bottom 
                  of the socket. This could compress the base of the countersink, leading 
                  to bone loss. Another is that the implant bottoms out in the socket, 
                  leaving a space between the neck of the implant and the base of the 
                  countersink. This could also contribute to bone loss. Today, Paragon 
                  makes length-specific drills with built-in countersinks for its external 
                  hex Taper-Lock implants. This drill design helps ensure that the implant 
                  bottoms in the socket and on the countersink at the same time. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another possibility for the 
                  bone loss associated with the Branemark implant is the imprecise fit 
                  between the implants and abutments (Dellow AG, Driessen CH, Nel HJC: 
                  Int J Prosthodont 1997;10:216-221). This has resulted in microbial leakage 
                  through the implant-abutment interface with subsequent bacterial colonization 
                  of internal surfaces of the implants (Persson LG et al., Clin Oral Impl 
                  Res 1996;7:90-95; Quirynen M et al., Clin Oral Impl Res 1994;5:239-244; 
                  Koka S et al., J Prosthet Dent 1993;70:141-144). It also allows rotational 
                  wobble between mated Branemark implants and abutments. Binon, for example, 
                  documented 6.7 degrees of abutment rotation with the Branemark System 
                  (Binon PP, Int J Prosthodont 1995;8(2):162-178). Lateral forces will 
                  cause tipping with the abutment joint cyclically opening and closing, 
                  causing percolation of bacteria from the junction. This undoubtedly 
                  would contribute to bone moving away from this junction. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT ALL 
                  TWO-PIECE IMPLANT SYSTEMS HAVE THESE SAME LIMITATIONS. Paragon's friction-fit 
                  abutments and internal hex with lead-in bevel eliminate all tipping 
                  and rotational movements (Binon PP, Postgraduate Dent1996;3(1):3-13). 
                  The "Biological Width" theory is thus most likely based on a false premise 
                  from observations made on the Branemark System. Bone loss is inevitable 
                  if the ridge is thin, and is of little consequence if it is only a few 
                  millimeters in height. If it were the junction between mating parts 
                  that was causing the bone loss, why does Staumann's one-stage ITI&reg; 
                  implant that has the supragingival junction still experience bone loss?</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some have suggested that 
                  a two-stage implant with a polished collar would provide better tissue 
                  health if the collar were left above the tissue. However, this would 
                  position the threads of the implant at the crest of the ridge. Exposed 
                  threads can't be a good thing, especially in an HA- or TPS-coated implant. 
                  Soft tissue health certainly has been demonstrated with smooth titanium 
                  healing collars and abutments. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I believe that, regardless 
                  of whether a two-piece implant is selected for a two-stage procedure 
                  or to position the margin as far subgingival as possible for esthetics, 
                  the top of the implant should be placed level with the crest of the 
                  ridge. Furthermore, the implant's surfaces should be designed with a 
                  1mm smooth machined (not polished) neck to accommodate for the 1 mm 
                  of bone loss that most likely will occur just from the surgical insult 
                  to the bone. Below this relatively smooth neck region, a medium-rough 
                  surface should be placed to retard bone recession. If one wants a rougher 
                  coated surface on the implant, it should be separated from the 1 mm 
                  smooth neck by a 2 mm, medium-rough blasted zone. Paragon offers such 
                  a design, which is called the Dual Transition™ Selective Surface™. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a one-stage procedure 
                  is desired, the implant should be designed to accomplish this with a 
                  2-3 mm long neck that projects above the endosseous portion of the implant, 
                  as in the ITI, AdVent™ and SwissPlus™ implants. In the maxillary anterior 
                  esthetic zone, the use of a two-stage implant in conjunction with a 
                  healing collar for a one-stage surgical protocol is acceptable. It is 
                  even advisable to do so if the tissue is less than 3mm thick. A secure, 
                  friction-fit internal connection (Tapered Screw-Vent) would eliminate 
                  concerns about microleakage caused by micromovements. Steri-Oss' Replace 
                  Select™ implant, which claims to be usable as a one- or two-stage implant, 
                  requires leaving the implant body extending 2 mm above the crest of 
                  the ridge, which brings the rough coating and threads to the crest of 
                  the bone where they will be easily exposed to the soft tissue with a 
                  minimal amount of bone recession. Steri-Oss' ads show this implant used 
                  one-stage, but with a healing collar attached to maintain the opening 
                  through the soft tissue. A true one-stage implant should be able to 
                  accomplish this without the need to purchase extra parts. </font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EARLY YEARS</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Core-Vent Corporation was 
                  started in 1982 to market the two-piece, hollow-basket, Core-Vent&reg; 
                  implant. The original design featured a Hex-Hole&#153;; that accepted 
                  a variety of cemented posts. Due to its reasonable price, which was 
                  substantially lower than the Branemark&reg; System at the time, and 
                  easily accessible education programs, the Core-Vent implant became the 
                  most widely used root-form implant in the world by 1986. Other systems 
                  were also first introduced around that time. The IMZ® System, for example, 
                  which is still marketed, but essentially defunct. The Calcitek® System, 
                  as another example, coated the implant to its top, and the abutment 
                  fit against it. Unfortunately, the resulting soft tissue problems contributed 
                  to giving HA a bad reputation. A third example is the Steri-Oss® System, 
                  which was first introduced as the Denar® System. The initial implant 
                  design was a screw that accepted cemented abutments, and featured a 
                  4mm long smooth neck.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SPECTRA-SYSTEM® EVOLUTION 
                  PERIOD: 1986-1990</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1986, Core-Vent broke 
                  the tradition of one design for each implant company by introducing 
                  a second design targeted at the Branemark business. This was the Screw-Vent® 
                  implant, which featured the same thread design (0.6 mm pitch) and made 
                  from the same material (weak Grade 1 commercially pure titanium). In 
                  time, that choice of metal proved not to be a good idea. The Screw-Vent 
                  did bring two innovations to the industry. The first was its self-tapping 
                  design: vertical cutting groove and threads to the apex. The second 
                  was a unique internal Hex-Thread® connection (US Patent # 4,960,381). 
                  Core-Vent Corporation added three other implant designs over the next 
                  three years. The Micro-Vent® (1987) was the first small-diameter (3.25mmD), 
                  root-form implant and the first HA-coated screw implant. This implant 
                  featured a unique design (ledges on body with apical threads) and a 
                  unique surgical protocol (push-in for ease of insertion, with final 
                  thread-in for stability). The Swede-Vent® implant (1987) was the first 
                  real Branemark clone. Finally, the Bio-Vent® HA-coated cylinder featured 
                  vertical grooves and apical vents to alleviate hydraulic resistance 
                  to full seating.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1990, to make some sense 
                  of this array of hardware, Core-Vent introduced the Spectra-System concept 
                  of designating different implants for different locations of the jaw. 
                  Soon afterwards, the V.A. clinical study that evaluated 2800 of these 
                  implants at 32 U.S. government Veterans Affairs Hospitals began. The 
                  V.A. study primarily proved that HA-coated implants achieved and maintained 
                  significantly higher success than acid-etched implants, and overcame 
                  limitations of soft bone, surgeon's inexperience and even smoking. Approximately 
                  700 Micro-Vents were included in the study, of which 97.5% achieved 
                  3-5 year success. The crystallinity of the HA used in this study was 
                  not as low as the HA applied to the implants in the late 1980's, and 
                  not as high as the HA used by Paragon today. Review the V.A, study results

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">DENTSPLY PERIOD: 1991-1997</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the 6-year period from 
                  April 1, 1991, to May 31, 1997, Dentsply International distributed the 
                  products still manufactured by Core-Vent Bio-Engineering. In 1994, the 
                  external hex of Core-Vent’s Swede-Vent® implant was redesigned to incorporate 
                  a patented 1.5-degree taper (U.S. Pat. #5,433,606). The name was changed 
                  to Swede-Vent TL (Taper-Lock), and provided a very stable friction-fit 
                  connection when used with Swede-Vent abutments. The Swede-Vent TL was 
                  still only available in 4.0mmD with a Branemark®-compatible platform 
                  (4.1mmD/0.7mm-high hex).</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1996, the Screw-Vent’s 
                  strength was improved by increasing the neck diameter from 3.5mmD to 
                  3.7mmD, which necessitated design of length-specific drills with built-in 
                  countersinks. Maximum strength was further ensured by eliminating the 
                  use of Grade 4 CP Ti in favor of titanium alloy, which had been offered 
                  as an option since 1990. The diameter options of the Screw-Vent were 
                  increased to include a 3.3mmD (still with a 3.7mmD neck) and a 4.7mmD 
                  body. This Screw-Vent line was further expanded during this time to 
                  include Healing Collar Packaging for one-stage surgery. Together, these 
                  Screw-Vent Implants were called the Paragon System. The word "paragon" 
                  means "the standard by which all others are judged." </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CORE-VENT CHANGES ITS NAME 
                  TO PARAGON: 1997</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When Core-Vent regained distribution 
                  of its product lines in 1997, the company changed its name to Paragon 
                  Implant Company. This may have led to some confusion between the name 
                  of the company and the name given to the one-stage Screw-Vent implants 
                  packaged with healing collars. From April 1997 through the end of 1999, 
                  Core-Vent/Paragon introduced several new product changes. Among these, 
                  the Micro-Vent was tapered and reintroduced as the Micro-Vent2® and 
                  a 5.7mmD implant was added to this line. Paragon also introduced the 
                  Complete® Implant, a one-stage, one-piece implant with a platform compatible 
                  with the Branemark Standard Abutment. Its 3mmL neck extension could 
                  be used as the abutment for screw-retained restorations, or adapters 
                  (abutments) could be added similar to 2-piece implants. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 1997, the Swede-Vent 
                  TL implant line was expanded to include 3.3mmD and 4.7mmD options, all 
                  with the same platform as the 3.7mmD implant. In 1999, Paragon's triple 
                  lead threads were also added for three-times faster insertion and 12% 
                  less torque than single-thread implants. The material was also changed 
                  to work-hardened Grade 4 commercially pure titanium that withstood 421 
                  lbs of compressive load at 30 degrees and 22.1 in-lbs of torque. The 
                  increased strength of its hex, coupled with Paragon’s Selective Surface® 
                  process of leaving HA-coated or SBM-blasted implants with an uncoated, 
                  machined apical end (US. Pat #5,571,017), made self-tapping insertion 
                  possible in all qualities of bone. The fixture mount that comes preattached 
                  to the implant was also redesigned in 1999 to serve as a transfer and 
                  temporary abutment. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 1999, the advantages of 
                  the Complete Implant and the Screw-Vent implant with Healing Collar 
                  packaging, both one-stage implants, were combined into the AdVent, which 
                  replaced these designs. The AdVent Implant offers several significant 
                  improvements:</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. The platform changed to 
                  a 3.0mmD internal hex with greater prosthetic versatility. It can accept 
                  a ZAAG Attachment (Zest Co.) for overdenture retention, and also accepts 
                  a full range of prosthetic abutments compatible with Paragon’s two-stage 
                  internal hex implants.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The body was tapered. 
                  In soft bone, the socket is prepared with straight drills for compression 
                  of the bone or expansion of narrow ridges. In dense bone, step drills 
                  allow self-tapping insertion of the implant. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. The threads changed from 
                  a single-thread design to triple lead threads that reduce insertion 
                  time. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. The Advent is packaged 
                  with a 2mmL Implant Extender that provides greater versatility in projecting 
                  the implant through the soft tissue for one-stage healing.</font></p>

                  2000</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With the start of the 21st 
                  century, Paragon introduced the Tapered Screw-Vent®, which adopted the 
                  body design and surgical protocol of the AdVent implant and the Dual 
                  Transition® Selective Surface™ of the Micro-Vent2™ implant. The Tapered 
                  Screw-Vent is packaged for two-stage insertion with color-coded fixture 
                  mounts designed for use as transfers. This implant is destined to replace 
                  the tapered Micro-Vent2 and the standard Screw-Vent, as it combines 
                  the best features of both with the added advantages of triple lead threads. 
                  It will undoubtedly also replace the Bio-Vent® cylinder implant, because 
                  it is as easy to insert, provides added initial stability and is packaged 
                  with a Fixture Mount/Transfer that facilitates stage-one impressions. 
                  As dental professionals start to load implants earlier, and as more 
                  implants are placed immediately in extraction sockets, the design advantages 
                  of the Tapered Screw-Vent compared to the straight, non-threaded Bio-Vent 
                  become even more obvious.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In reference to the comment 
                  that Paragon implants are very good, as are 3 to 4 others, one needs 
                  to define what features are important in a system, and then look for 
                  the system that offers the greatest number of these advantages. In evolving 
                  the AdVent and Tapered Screw-Vent into what is, in my opinion, the <i>paragon</i> 
                  of implant systems, here is what I considered important:</font></p>

                      tapered implant design allows the tip of the implant to initiate 
                      insertion into an undersized socket, then expands soft bone to maximize 
                      initial stability.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;&#9;<b>ii.</b> Double-cutting 
                      step drills reduce the number of drills needed to prepare the osteotomy. 
                      Since they are only used as final sizing drills in dense bone, they 
                      can be slightly wider (3.4 mmD vs. 3.2 mmD, 4.4 mmD vs. 4.2 mmD) 
                      than the straight drills. This reduces the insertion torque needed 
                      for self-tapping in dense bone. </font></p>

                      Bio-Vent) are packaged with fixture mounts that also serve as transfers 
                      and temporary abutments. Paragon's SwissPlus features a fixture

                    new 3.7mmD Tapered Screw-Vent and AdVent implants can withstand 378lbs

                    with demonstrated higher percentage of bone attachment and removal 
                    torque than machined or acid-etched surfaces. Blasted and HA-coated 
                    surfaces outperform the very rough TPS surfaces, and all of these 
                    achieve greater bone contact than acid-etched and machined surfaces. 
                    TPS and beaded surfaces have a potential for soft tissue complications 
                    if they become exposed, due to their interconnecting pores. </font></p>

                    of the implant/abutment connection. Screw loosening has been demonstrated 
                    to relate to the rotational wobble between mating parts. Paragon's 
                    patented internal hex reduced rotational wobble from 4-6 degrees down 
                    to 1.4 degrees (Binon) and Paragon's friction-fit abutments totally 
                    eliminate rotation and tipping movements that cause screw loosening.

                    confusion in product selection.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#9;<b>H.</b> Cost and 
                    Value Equation. The least expensive implant to buy may cost more chair 
                    time for insertion and management of complications. On the other hand, 
                    paying a high price for a product does not assure its quality or its 
                    efficacy. One needs to be discerning and not influenced by "opinion 
                    leaders" who probably don't pay for their implants, and often get 
                    paid just for advocating the use of a particular system. The AdVent 
                    is a medium-priced implant with many patented features, and the top 
                    of the implant can be used as the abutment in screw-retained cases. 
                    It is packaged with an implant extender that eliminates the need to 
                    purchase healing collars of varying heights to maintain the tissue 
                    opening. Fixture mounts on two-stage implants that are usable as the 
                    transfer and even the abutment save additional costs. The most costly 
                    product is one that fails to integrate. Clinicians must look for features 
                    in the surgical protocol and surface options that will overcome soft 
                    bone limitations and inexperience. </font></p>

                  is very good, as are 3 to 4 others, not all implants and implant companies 
                  are created equal. It takes the discerning dentist to differentiate 
                  between competing product claims... and a discerning manufacturer to 
                  try to differentiate its product through features and benefits rather 
                  than through its marketing and hired opinion leaders.</font></p>
