                <b><font face="Times,Times New Roman" size="5"> 
                <p align="CENTER">OPEN LETTER TO THE DENTAL PROFESSION</p>
                </font></b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
                <p>Many of you have received a letter from Nobelpharma USA, Inc.* citing 
                  several allegations that constitute their lawsuit against Core-Vent 
                  Corporation. This suit seeks to prevent Core-Vent from interpreting 
                  the Br&aring;nemark research and other published research on the Biotes 
                  System in a manner that is contrary to Nobelpharma’s interests. Nobelpharma’s 
                  lawsuit before the United States District Court in Los angeles does 
                  not request one penny in damages.</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation believes that Br&aring;nemark’s published research 
                  belongs to the profession, not to the company marketing the hardware 
                  used in the clinical research. Core-Vent further believes that the proper 
                  forum for scientific debate is in published articles and professional 
                  symposiums.</p>
                <p>It is impossible for Core-Vent to adequately respond to this letter, 
                  which continues to be widely distributed by Nobelpharma, since we do 
                  not know exactly who received it nor how many copies have been circulated. 
                  We do know that the members of the dental community who have received 
                  the letter now have a right to know the true nature of the lawsuit, 
                  and to be apprised of our position and counter suit. Therefore, we are 
                  sending this response letter to every oral surgeon, periodontist, and 
                  prosthodontist in this country and Canada.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s Allegations</p>
                <p>1.&#9;Nobelpharma’s letter states: &quot;The FDA has not approved Core-Vent’s 
                  device or material.&quot;</p>
                <p>&#9;Core-Vent Corporation’s Response: "Core-Vent received the identical 
                  authority from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
                  for the marketing of its endosseous screw implant, known around the 
                  world by its registered United States Trademark, Core-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup>, 
                  as the Br&aring;nemark (Biotes) implant. FDA permission to</p>
                <p>______________________________________________ </p>
                <p>* The American subsidiary of a Swedish corporation known as Bofors 
                  Nobelpharma or Nobelpharma AB</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>market the Core-Vent Implant was granted on March 11, 1982 pursuant 
                  to Section 510K of the Federal Act –– Core-Vent No. K820163A. Core-Vent 
                  Corporation’s federal FDA registration number is No. 2025501, and the 
                  Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch of the State of 
                  California, has granted Core-Vent a device-manufacturing License No. 
                  60611. </p>
                <p>&#9;A Nobelpharma interoffice memo recently obtained by Core-Vent Corporation 
                  suggests that the FDA allegation in their letter was misleading: &quot;...the 
                  FDA has approved use of titanium alloy for implants...at the present 
                  time, we cannot prove that the use of titanium alloy (as opposed to 
                  the use of pure titanium) has a negative impact.&quot;</p>
                <p>2.&#9;Nobelpharma’s letter states that its legal action &quot;does 
                  not seek to prevent Core-Vent from offering a competing system&quot; 
                  but demands that Core-Vent &quot;refrain from misusing the work of Dr. 
                  Br&aring;nemark and his colleagues.&quot;</p>
                <b>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation’s Response:</p>
                </b> 
                <p>&#9;The efforts by Nobelpharma and the Br&aring;nemark disciples to 
                  redefine and reinterpret the research results seem to be in direct response 
                  to Core-Vent’s increased professional acceptance. A recent article by 
                  Albrektsson, Zarb, Worthington and Eriksson in the first issue of the 
                  Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants (Quintessence Publishing 
                  Co.) proposed the third definition of osseointegration by the same researchers 
                  in the last three years. This article supports my interpretation of 
                  the Br&aring;nemark research by acknowledging that: "...the Br&aring;nemark 
                  results...clearly underscore the basic concept of osseointegration as 
                  being the major, if not the exclusive, reason for a successful long-term 
                  dental implant attachment."</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Implants have proven to be osseointegrated in both animal 
                  (JOMS, June 1986) and clinical studies (LSU Implant Symposium: Lubar 
                  and Katin –– 95% three-year success). A human specimen removed after 
                  two years in function for psychological reasons demonstrated osseointegration 
                  on light and scanning electron microscopy (see &quot;Osseointegration&quot; 
                  reprint enclosed).</p>
