                <p>In the interview article on dental implants in the December issue, 
                  the JADA questioned five dentists and a biomaterials expert on Implantology. 
                  One question posed by the JADA was: &quot;What types of implants and 
                  materials are currently used?&quot;</p>
                <p>To this, Dr. Thomas Golec, an Oral Surgeon from San Diego, responded: 
                  "Today, most if not all subperiosteal implants are made from surgical 
                  Vitallium. This material should be coated with hydroxylapatite. Most 
                  endosseous implants, whether blade- or cylinder-type implants, are made 
                  from commercially available pure titanium. Again, these should be coated 
                  with hydroxylapatite to increase speed and predictability of integration."</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>A close review of the research does not confirm Dr. Golec’s claims 
                  of the advantages of coating endosseous implants with hydroxylapatite 
                  (HA), and no clinical or animal studies can be found in the literature 
                  related to its efficacy on subperiosteal implants.</p>
                <p>Dr. Dan Laskin, Editor of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 
                  stated in an editorial entitled, &quot;Implantology ‘86&quot; (November 
                  issue[Vol. 44, No. 11]): "It is understandable that manufacturers praise 
                  their own products, but we would hope that we can at least turn to our 
                  professional colleagues for a less biased appraisal...Unfortunately, 
                  the impact of commercialism, and the political and economic conflicts 
                  within our own profession related to the use of implants, often seems 
                  to delay rather than to hasten the needed progress...The time has come 
                  for us to take a harder look at what is going on in the field."</p>
                <p>ANIMAL RESEARCH ON HYDROXYLAPATITE-COATED IMPLANTS:</p>
                <p>The results of dog studies by Drs. John Kent, Chairman of Oral Surgery, 
                  LSU, Michael Jarcho, President of Cacitek, and others were published 
                  in the Lsu Implant Symposium Abstract Book (March 1986) and in transcripts 
                  of other meetings (Trans. 12th Ann. Mtg. Soc. Biomaterials, 14, 1986). 
                  They reported on push-out tests of HA-coated and uncoated titanium cylindrical 
                  implants with three different surface characteristics –– smooth, fluted 
                  and porous. All were tested after various unloaded healing periods in 
                  dogs. One finding was: "On the uncoated dense (smooth) titanium surfaces, 
                  a thin fibrous interface was present around all specimens. The HA coated 
                  dense surfaces, however, demonstrated no fibrous tissue layers at any 
                  time period and demonstrated mineralization directly onto the surface 
                  of the implant."</p>
                <p>The HA-coated titanium cylinders demonstrated osseointegration (absence 
                  of fibrous tissue at the interface of bone and implant) while the uncoated 
                  smooth titanium implants did not. The claim is made by the researchers 
                  that the difference in surface responses was due to the difference in 
                  materials. A more likely explanation is that the smooth configuration 
                  of the titanium cylinder did not allow for the immediate fixation essential 
                  for osseointegration. Adding HA coating to titanium cylinders would 
                  increase surface texture, ensuring the needed initial fixation. Previous 
                  research by Dr. Steve cook, one of the co-researchers with Kent and 
                  Jarcho, compared smooth and grit-blasted titanium implants in dogs (Journal 
                  of Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 19, 1985) and proved that osseointegration 
                  was highly dependent on surface irregularities: "It was found that rough 
                  surfaced implants exhibited apparent direct bone apposition, whereas 
                  smooth surfaced implants exhibited varying degrees of fibrous encasement."</p>
                <p>CLAIM OF STRONGER BONDING WITH HA COATING ON TITANIUM:</p>
                <p>The claim of stronger bonding of bone to HA-coated endosseous implants 
                  is based on push-out strength tests. Kent et al. compared non-osseointegrated, 
                  smooth titanium cylinders to osseointegrated HA-coated cylinders and, 
                  as would be expected, the smooth design of the uncoated, non-osseointegrated 
                  implant was less resistent to displacement than the osseointegrated 
                  HA-coated implant: "The dense (smooth) titanium systems with HA coatings 
                  showed an approximately 2-3 times increase (8 MPa [1200 psi] vs 2-3 
                  MPa [300-500 psi]) in interface attachment strength when compared to 
                  the non-HA coated systems."</p>
                <p>The claim that the surface coating of HA, in itself, provides greater 
                  attachment, is not substantiated by the other findings of their study. 
                  With the porous surfaces, both coated and uncoated implants osseointegrated 
                  and the push-out strengths were equal. The magnitudes far exceeded that 
                  of the smooth cylinders, which more closely conform to the commercially 
                  available design of HA-coated implants: "The mechanical testing for 
                  the porous system with and without the HA coating showed that the long-term 
                  maximum interface strengths were equivalent at about 20 MPa (2,900 psi)."</p>
                <p>Cook’s presentation at the LSU Implant Symposium in March, 1986, showed 
                  histological evidence that, under push-out tests with the fluted titanium 
                  implants, failure occurred at the HA metal interface with the coated 
                  implants. The fluted titanium implants without HA coating maintained 
                  the titanium-bone integrity with fracture consistently occurring in 
                  the bone itself. To date, this observation, made in front of a large 
                  audience, has not been published. My attempts to obtain copies of the 
                  histological slides from one of the co-researchers has met with refusal 
                  on the basis that Calcitek funded the study and I would have to get 
                  their permission. Clinical experience with loaded HA-coated implants 
                  is very limited but, already, early reports by Dr. Dan Patrick of Long 
                  Beach, California, and Dr. Charley Dodge of Walnut Creek, California 
                  (personal communication) indicate that separation of the HA from the 
                  metal has been observed clinically.</p>
                <p>CLAIM OF FASTER OSSEOINTEGRATION WITH HA COATING ON TITANIUM:</p>
                <p>The research report of S.D. Cook, J. Kay and M. Jarcho et al. (Kay 
                  and Jarcho are employees of Calcitek) (Trans. 12th Ann. Mtg. Soc. Biomaterials, 
                  14, 1986) stated: "In the case of porous implants, the long-term (32 
                  weeks) maximum interface strengths were equivalent for both coated and 
                  non-coated implants. However, the HA-coated porous implants reached 
                  this maximum strength approximately twice as fast as the uncoated porous 
                  implants."</p>
                <p>This statement implies that it took 32 weeks to reach &quot;maximum 
                  interface strengths&quot; for the non coated porous titanium implants, 
                  but half this time for HA-coated porous implants. This is contradictory 
                  by Cook’s other report (abstract published in LSU Implant Symposium 
                  Book, March 22, 1986): "Results of the mechanical testing for the porous 
                  system with and without the HA coating showed that the long-term maximum 
                  interface strengths were equivalent at about 20 MPa; however, the rate 
                  of development of the maximum interface strength was approximately halved. 
                  This time period was approximately 3-6 weeks for the HA-coated porous 
                  titanium systems as compared to the 6-12 weeks for the non-HA-coated 
                  system."</p>
                <p>This statement confirms that the maximum interface strength of both 
                  types of implants was reached within 6-12 weeks, not the 32 weeks implied 
                  in the previous report. Since the time periods overlap, it is doubtful 
                  that a statistically significant difference existed between test results. 
                  In any case, there is no proven clinical advantage, since the same 3-4 
                  month submerged healing period is recommended for the HA-coated implant 
                  from Calcitek as for the Core-Vent and Biotes implants. Histological 
                  reports from Ken et al. (LSU Symposium Abstract) confirm the need to 
                  wait this time period. "The early (1 month) specimens (HA-coated) were 
                  not completely encased by bone. Bony trabeculae extended to the implant, 
                  with these trabecular attachments to the implant separated from each 
                  other by cancellous marrow elements. By four months, the bone implant 
                  interface was more consolidated with the formation of a layer of lamellar 
                  bone."</p>
                <p>Calcitek’s instruction manual confirms that the HA coating does not 
                  shorten the healing period: "As a general guideline, a healing period 
                  of approximately three to four months is allowed for optimum osseointegration 
                  and bone bonding to the Calcitite-coated Integral implant."</p>
                <p>Note that &quot;bone bonding&quot; and &quot;osseointegration&quot; 
                  are considered as two separate interfacial entities by Calcitek.</p>
                <p>OSSEOINTEGRATION –– THE LEGACY: </p>
                <p>In a recent article by Albrektsson, Zarb et al. in the Journal of Oral 
                  and Maxillofacial Implants, Vol. 1, 1986, the authors stated: "The Br&aring;nemark 
                  results...clearly underscore the basic concept of osseointegration as 
                  being the major, if not the exclusive, reason for a successful long-term 
                  dental implant attachment."</p>
                <p>Br&aring;nemark and his co-researchers have proven, with 20 years of 
                  clinical testing, the long-term predictability of a titanium oxide-bone 
                  interface. This same titanium oxide surface, as now proven with Auger 
                  analysis, also exists on the surface of medical grade titanium alloy. 
                  The Core-Vent Implant (titanium alloy) has demonstrated achievement 
                  and maintenance of osseointegration in 5 years of wide clinical use 
                  (now in 3,000 dental offices). The interfacial phenomenon referred to 
                  as osseointegration demonstrates under SEM 20-40 &Aring;ngstroms of 
                  glycoprotein between the bone and the titanium oxide surface. If &quot;bone 
                  bonding&quot; exists and is different than osseointegration (manufacturer 
                  claims it’s better), how then can the long-term predictability of osseointegration 
                  be extrapolated to the HA surface?</p>
                <p>RATIONALE FOR HA COATING OF ENDOSSEOUS IMPLANTS:</p>
                <p>The question that must ultimately be answered relative to the efficacy 
                  of HA coating of titanium or titanium alloy is: Does HA coating solve 
                  a problem that doesn’t exist while creating potential problems of its 
                  own? It appears that the rationale for coating implants with HA is based 
                  on the &quot;chicken soup&quot; theory ––– i.e. it may not help but 
                  it can’t hurt. At this point, we don’t know what the long-term ramifications 
                  of &quot;bone bonding&quot; will be or even the long-term maintenance 
                  of the HA-metal interface. </p>
                <p>One of the five dentists questioned in the JADA interview was Dr. Roland 
                  Meffert, Chairman of the Graduate Periodontic Program at LSU. This school 
                  has been involved with HA coating on Calcitek’s implants since the implant’s 
                  creation. He stated at the American Association of Periodontists National 
                  Meeting in Cleveland, September, 1986: "We’ve just been working with 
                  the HA (Calcitek Implant)...I think the longest case we have restored 
                  now is a year, a year plus...we don’t know two years from now, three 
                  years from now, four years from now what is going to happen."</p>
                <p>The other argument for its use is that it may provide an extra margin 
                  for error if one of the principles proven essential for osseointegration 
                  is violated. The compromise paid in implant design in order to provide 
                  that flat surface needed for coating is the elimination of threads. 
                  Threads on an implant ensure immediate fixation, increased surface area 
                  for load distribution and facilitate insertion and immediate removal 
                  for repositioning if this is necessary. These real clinical factors 
                  far outweigh any theoretical gains based on a few dog studies of unloaded 
                  implants. In fact, the studies showed that the interfacial strength 
                  increased 250% by using a porous design over the smooth cylinder.</p>
                <p>The recent professional and public acceptance of implantology as a 
                  viable alternative to conventional dental procedures offers dentists 
                  a new challenge. Dr. Dan Laskin put it succinctly in his editorial in 
                  the November 1986 issue of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery:</p>
                <p>&#9;Although we are making great strides in our understanding of implant 
                  design and the proper use of biomaterials, we still have much to learn 
                  in both areas. Unfortunately, the impact of commercialism, and the political 
                  and economic conflicts within our own profession related to the use 
                  of implants, often seems to delay rather than to hasten the needed progress.</p>
