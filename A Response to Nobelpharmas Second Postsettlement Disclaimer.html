                </font></b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
                <p>Nobelpharma and Core-Vent Corporation, according to the Joint Settlement 
                  Announcement of January 15, 1989, reached &quot;an amicable end to the 
                  controversy between the two companies.&quot; Unfortunately, in just 
                  six weeks following the settlement agreement, Nobelpharma sent two open 
                  letters to the profession that contained misleading statements regarding 
                  the settlement and other related issues. Core-Vent responded to Nobelpharma’s 
                  January 15th letter (copies available upon request) regarding the extent 
                  and significance of the license granted to Core-Vent Corporation for 
                  the patents issued to P-I Br&aring;nemark, including U.S. Patent No. 
                  4,330,891. Core-Vent must now respond to Nobelpharma’s February 20, 
                  1989 letter which makes a number of statements allegedly in response 
                  to questions from Nobelpharma’s customers who &quot;were told of a supposed 
                  relationship between Nobelpharma USA, Inc., and Core-Vent Corporation.&quot; 
                </p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s February 20th letter by its president, Mr. Bill Ryan, 
                  makes several factual statements that leave the reader with the false 
                  impression that Core-Vent Corporation has made statements to the contrary. 
                  The letter then claims that a failure of Core-Vent to respond must be 
                  construed as an agreement with Nobelpharma’s position: "When you have 
                  truth on your side, you are NEVER afraid to put it in writing. I have 
                  been asked to do so and here it is. Anyone who tells you something to 
                  the contrary also should put it in writing. If they will not, then you 
                  know the value of their words."</p>
                <p>The Nobelpharma letter implies that Core-Vent Corporation has claimed 
                  to be a &quot;distributor or agent&quot; for Nobelpharma or &quot;authorized 
                  by Nobelpharma to provide training in the Br&aring;nemark System.&quot; 
                  Nobelpharma’s transparent attempt to gain credibility by raising non-issues 
                  and challenging Core-Vent to disagree would not be worthy of a response 
                  if it were not for the false impression that would be left if Core-Vent 
                  did not accept Nobelpharma’s invitation to respond in writing. This 
                  cycle of Nobelpharma’s misleading letters and Core-Vent’s responses 
                  will end when Nobelpharma is made to realize by the profession that 
                  this type of marketing rhetoric is counter productive. Nobelpharma’s 
                  letter does raise several issues which, I believe, deserve a scientifically 
                  supported response. </p>
                <p>The letter falsely states that the Swede-Vent’s surface may be both 
                  sandblasted and acid etched:</p>
                <p>&#9;Core-Vent Implants, including Swede-Vent, DO NOT HAVE AN IDENTICAL 
                  SURFACE to the Br&aring;nemark System&trade; implants –– they are either 
                  sandblasted, acid etched (or both), or coated with hydroxylapatite. 
                  The Br&aring;nemark System&trade; implants have a precision machined 
                  surface.</p>
                <p>Core-Vent, Screw-Vent and Swede-Vent implants are only sold with an 
                  acid-etched surface in order to remove surface contamination from machining 
                  and deburring procedures. Although the Swede-Vent and Screw-Vent implants 
                  now have the surface patented by Br&aring;nemark, Core-Vent Corporation 
                  has never claimed that the surface is identical to Nobelpharma’s. Core-Vent 
                  has emphasized in its literature and lectures the important differences 
                  between the surfaces. </p>

                </b> 
                <p>Br&aring;nemark’s U.S. Patent No. 4,330,891, granted in 1982, states: 
                  &quot;An analysis of jaw implants in homo&quot; showed that &quot;the 
                  bio-optimal result&quot; could be achieved using &quot;a biologically 
                  flawless material with a porous, i.e., micro-pitted surface intended 
                  to face the tissue.&quot; </p>
                <p>The Swede-Vent and Screw-Vent pure titanium implants from Core-Vent 
                  Corporation, ACCORDING TO AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT NOMINATED BY NOBELPHARMA, 
                  do provide the type of micro-pitted surface specified in Br&aring;nemark’s 
                  patent. According to Br&aring;nemark’s statements under oath to the 
                  U.S. Patent Office, this surface will provide &quot;inextricable anchoring 
                  in the living bone tissue.&quot; According to a study funded by Nobelpharma, 
                  it was found that machined titanium surfaces &quot;are not metallurgically 
                  satisfactory and can detract from the suitability of the implants for 
                  service.&quot; The report by Taussig Metallurgical Engineers strongly 
                  recommended Nobelpharma to wash their implants in acid (passivation) 
                  to &quot;eat out any metallic particles.&quot; Core-Vent instituted 
                  acid etching procedures in 1986 and, during the last three years, has 
                  conducted extensive tests using SEM, EDAX and Auger analysis, and built 
                  its own Class 10,000 Clean Room facility in an attempt to perfect the 
                  cleaning process and provide the profession with &quot;a biologically 
                  flawless&quot; or superclean surface. </p>

                  available from Core Vent Corporation), examined Nobelpharma implants 
                  that &quot;had been packaged in sealed glass containers&quot; with &quot;a 
                  representative of the Br&aring;nemark Company being present.&quot; Examination 
                  using &quot;scanning electron microscope and Energy Dispersion X-ray 
                  Analysis of two samples representing titanium dental implants&quot; 
                  revealed the following:</p>
                <p>&#9;It appeared that the grinding of the surface of the implant produced 
                  a number of titanium particles that were partially dislodged, and/or 
                  folded over onto the surface of the implants.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Energy Dispersion X-ray Analysis of this dark appearing particle 
                    revealed that the primary element was lead. In addition, there was 
                    a significant amount of tin. Other elements present were silicon, 
                    aluminum, magnesium and iron.</li>
                  <li>This particle is primarily a piece of silicon and magnesium oxide.</li>

                <p>THE NOBELPHARMA SURFACE ANALYSIS REPORT CONCLUDED:</p>
                </b> 
                <p>&#9;"Br&aring;nemark implants exhibited evidence of nonmetallic particles 
                  on the surface of the implants while the implants had been sealed in 
                  glass containers. Even though the implants have been rendered biologically 
                  sterile, the contamination of the metal surface by metallic particles 
                  had resulted in the implants being not sterile from a metallurgical 
                  point of view. It is our opinion that the metallic particles and nonmetallic 
                  particles that we observed on the Br&aring;nemark implant surfaces, 
                  as well as the numerous areas where the apparently ground surfaces have 
                  been folded over, are not metallurgically satisfactory and can detract 
                  from the suitability of the implants for service. The titanium surface 
                  can be and should be passivated (i.e. acid washed –– explanation added) 
                  similar to that process performed on stainless steel to eat out any 
                  metallic particles and to help reinforce the passive oxide film on the 
                  surface of the titanium. The dentist, periodontist or oral surgeon has 
                  every right to expect that the surfaces of the implants that they are 
                  inserting are clean and free from any particles that could possibly 
                  adversely affect the serviceability of that implant."</p>

                <p>THE CORE-VENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMS ETCHED SURFACE IS &quot;METALLURGICALLY 
                  IMPROVED&quot;</p>
                </b> 
                <p>Taussig Laboratories recently evaluated Core-Vent Corporations’s cleaning 
                  procedures and concluded:</p>
                <p>&#9;The general surface appearance of the Core-Vent, Screw-Vent and 
                  Swede-Vent implants, in our opinion, appear to be metallurgically improved 
                  over that of the Br&aring;nemark implants previously examined for Nobelpharma 
                  by our laboratory because the surface has been chemically passivated 
                  (acid etched) to &quot;eat-out&quot; any embedded metal particles. The 
                  surface of the Nobelpharma implant is machined which causes microscopic 
                  machining laps. These laps fold over metal particles and adhere these 
                  particles to the implant surface. </p>
                <p>The acid etching procedure used to clean the machined surfaces of the 
                  Screw-Vent and Swede-Vent implants increases the number of micro-pits 
                  in the 1-3 micron range. This is the important range Br&aring;nemark’s 
                  patent claims was shown by his research to &quot;approach the order 
                  of magnitude of the cell diameter&quot; and give &quot;operation results&quot; 
                  that were &quot;noticeably improved.&quot;</p>
                <p>SURFACE CONTAMINATION MAY BE CAUSE OF &quot;SECONDARY FAILURE OF OSSEOINTEGRATION&quot;</p>
                <p>Albrektsson, in an article in Dental Clinics of North America, January 
                  1986, stated:</p>
                <p>&#9;Secondary failure of osseointegration, when a primarily achieved 
                  bone anchorage is lost, sometimes years after insertion, may depend 
                  on a slight incompatibility of the used material, an unsuitable surface 
                  finish of the implant or an overloading.</p>
                <p>CLINICAL STUDIES SHOW &quot;SECONDARY FAILURE&quot; WITH NOBELPHARMA 
                  IMPLANT</p>
                <p>Studies have shown that the success rates of the Nobelpharma implant 
                  in the maxilla dropped dramatically with time:</p>
                <p>1. Albrektsson reported on a multi-national study with 90% success 
                  in the 1-7 year group dropping to 85% for the 5-7 years group –– Journal 
                  of Periodontology, May 1988.</p>
                <p>2. Adell reported upper bridge success of 96% after 1-4 years dripping 
                  to under 91% by the 6-10 year follow-up. Report on Br&aring;nemark Implants 
                  (unpublished) presented at Harvard University, November 1987.</p>
                <p>3. Moy et al. documented UCLA’s declining success rate with Nobelpharma 
                  implants in the maxilla in figure #1: "No fixtures were reported as 
                  failures at the second surgical appointment as they all appeared non-mobile 
                  at the time of exposure."</p>

                  of a Core-Vent Study by Dr. Patrick, Dr. Lubar, Dr. Buchs and Dr. Zosky 
                  (submitted for publication -- abstract available from Core Vent Corporation). 
                  The study showed a 98% success rate with 342 maxillary Core-Vent implants 
                  placed in partially edentulous jaws over a 3-64 month observation period. 
                  Only one implant was reported lost after the first year in function.</p>
                <p>EXTRAPOLATION OF BR&Aring;NEMARK RESEARCH TO SWEDE-VENT IMPLANT </p>
                <p>The Nobelpharma February 20th letter states: "The success rates relating 
                  to the Br&aring;nemark System&trade; ARE NOT applicable to Core-Vent 
                  implants, including Swede-Vent."</p>
                <p>Core-Vent continues to believe that the Br&aring;nemark implant research 
                  relates to long-term predictability of any implant that achieves osseointegration 
                  and maintains it for nine months in function. Core-Vent has not claimed 
                  that the results, good or bad, &quot;relating to the Br&aring;nemark 
                  System&trade; are applicable to the Core-Vent implants, including Swede-Vent.&quot;</p>
                <p>Core-Vent believes, based on the aforementioned studies, that, in the 
                  maxillary arch (and possibly in the lower posterior arch), the hollow-vented 
                  design of the Core-Vent Implant offers advantages with regard to maintaining 
                  osseointegration compared to solid screw design. Core-Vent does not 
                  recommend use of its Swede-Vent Implant in these applications for this 
                  reason and because it requires countersinking which further reduces 
                  cortical bone support.</p>
                <p>The Br&aring;nemark System&trade; and the Swede-Vent&reg; System have 
                  the following features in common –– the profession can decide for itself 
                  the significance of this with regard to extrapolation of success rates.</p>
                <p>&#9;1. The Swede-Vent and Nobelpharma fixtures both achieve osseointegration 
                  when properly inserted.</p>
                <p>&#9;2. Swede-Vent matches the original Br&aring;nemark implant in design, 
                  material and dimensions and has the surface that Br&aring;nemark stated 
                  in his patent would provide &quot;the bio-optimal result.&quot;</p>
                <p>&#9;3. Swede-Vent can be inserted using the Nobelpharma instruments 
                  and surgical protocol or placed using Swede-Vent internally irrigated 
                  drills that minimize heat generation and simplify the surgical procedures.</p>
                <p>&#9;4. Swede-Vent implants accept Nobelpharma’s prosthetic abutments 
                  as well as Swede-Vent’s new one-piece prosthetic abutments that have 
                  been shown by an Ohio State University study to be 30% stronger than 
                  Nobelpharma’s abutments.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s February 20th letter makes the claim that &quot;the success 
                  rates relating to the Br&aring;nemark System&trade; are not applicable 
                  to the...Swede-Vent,&trade;&quot; which has the aforementioned similarities 
                  to the original Br&aring;nemark implant. It is interesting to note that 
                  Nobelpharma has made no distinction between the success rates of the 
                  original Br&aring;nemark implant and Nobelpharma’s newly introduced 
                  (1988) self-tapping fixtures, which differ in thread design, neck design 
                  and surgical protocol from the original Br&aring;nemark implant reported 
                  in published research. Today’s Nobelpharma implants may also differ 
                  from those used in the long-term Br&aring;nemark clinical studies in 
                  surface oxide as a result of high heat sterilization of glass vials 
                  and changes over the years in cleaning solutions.</p>
                <p>Those dentists who have selected the Nobelpharma System in the past 
                  because of their confidence in Professor ‘s research can now feel more 
                  comfortable with the Screw-Vent and Swede-Vent implants knowing that 
                  an independent expert nominated by Nobelpharma found that the Screw 
                  Vent and Swede-Vent implants have the type of micro-pitted surface that 
                  Br&aring;nemark determined from his research to be important. Furthermore, 
                  these implants offer a superclean, acid-etched surface. Core-Vent believes, 
                  based on Albrektsson’s statements about &quot;secondary failures&quot; 
                  related to &quot;slight incompatibility&quot; that, if anything, the 
                  &quot;metallurgically improved&quot; surface available on the Screw-Vent 
                  and Swede-Vent implants may enhance long-term results compared to the 
                  type of surface that all implant initially have after machining.</p>
                <p>IMPLANTOLOGY IN THE 1990s –– THE DECADE OF PROSTHETIC VERSATILITY, 
                  SERVICE &amp; VALUE &#9;</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation has been a leader in implant innovation since 
                  1982 and has grown from four employees in September 1984 to over 120 
                  employees by 1988. The simplified surgical procedures and versatile 
                  prosthetics have made Core-Vent products well accepted by the profession 
                  and led to Core-Vent’s position as being the world’s largest supplier 
                  of dental implants. Core-Vent Corporation believes that quality products, 
                  customer service and reasonable prices have contributed to this growth. 
                  The success of the Core-Vent Implant has now been recognized by the 
                  American Dental Association with its recent decision to grant the Core-Vent 
                  Implant Provisional Acceptance after a thorough evaluation of clinical 
                  results and manufacturing practices. Hopefully this response letter 
                  will close the final chapter on the controversy between Nobelpharma 
                  and Core-Vent Corporation and both companies can now devote their financial 
                  resources and energies to competing on customer satisfaction, quality 
                  of products and value. Core-Vent Corporation welcomes the opportunity 
                  of earning the profession's business on this basis. </p>
