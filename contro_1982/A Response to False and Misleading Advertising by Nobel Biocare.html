            </b> 
            <p>Nobelpharma’s (formerly Nobel Biocare) recent advertisement (JADA, 
              JPD, Dec. ‘90) asks the legitimate question, &quot;Which Implant System 
              Give You and Your Patients the Most Security?&quot; It then lists a 
              number of marketing statements, referring to them as &quot;FACTS,&quot; 
              claiming that, with the Br&aring;nemark System<sup>&reg;1</sup>, &quot;The 
              Weight of Evidence is On Your Side!&quot; One can only answer Nobelpharma’s 
              question if one takes the time to analyze all of Nobelpharma’s marketing 
              claims, both current and abandoned, in relation to published research 
              results. This report will analyze a number of research studies, including 
              the publication of the 20-year results with Br&aring;nemark implants 
              at the University of Gothenburg (Adell<sup>2</sup>, JOMI, Vol. 5, No. 
              4, 1990). Over the years, Core-Vent has challenged what we have believed 
              to be false and misleading statements in the industry. Core-Vent believes 
              that, after 20+ years of documented studies reporting both the clinical 
              successes and failures of the Br&aring;nemark System&reg; and the limitations 
              and complications associated with the pure titanium screw implant designed 
              in 1965, it is time the profession took a hard look at the research 
              rather than rely on Nobelpharma’s slick marketing images and carefully 
              worded implications. If a company has a tendency to exaggerate some 
              facts, its future claims should be closely scrutinized.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <p> 1. Nobelpharma falsely claims in its brochure entitled, &quot;THE 
              UNIQUE METHOD OF TISSUE INTEGRATION,&quot; that P. I. Br&aring;nemark 
              &quot;discovered the ability of bone tissue to unite directly to titanium.&quot; 
              As of June, 1990, this same brochure now substitutes the word &quot;observed&quot; 
              for &quot;discovered&quot; because, according to Br&aring;nemark’s 1977 
              textbook, &quot;already in 1951 Leventhal in experimental studies observed 
              that bone appeared to become attached to titanium.&quot;</p>
            <p>2. Nobelpharma falsely claimed that the Br&aring;nemark fixture is 
              &quot;the only implant system that uses osseointegration as a method 
              of achieving a dental prosthesis permanently to the jawbone itself.&quot; 
              While this statement, which appeared in a 1988 Nobelpharma brochure, 
              was so blatantly untrue that Nobelpharma retracted it in a letter to 
              hundreds of dentists in this country, this brochure is still in circulation 
              in Japanese and Spanish language versions without correction.</p>
            <p>3. Nobelpharma continues to use a picture of what it claims is an osteoblast 
              attached to titanium when, in fact, this same picture appeared in a 
              1982 article by Albrektsson and Br&aring;nemark showing it to be a fibroblast 
              from skin around an ear implant.</p>
            <p>4. Adell<sup>2</sup> et al. report that, for implants placed between 
              1971 - 1981, &quot;continuous bridge stability&quot; in the maxilla 
              was 81-82% at 10 years, not the 96% at 5-12 years that Nobelpharma had 
              claimed in previously published advertisements.</p>
            <p>BEFORE SELECTING AN IMPLANT SYSTEM, SEPARATE MARKETING HYPE FROM PUBLISHED 
              FACTS</p>
            <p>In chapter 10 of Br&aring;nemark’s 1985 textbook, Adell defines &quot;continuous 
              bridge stability&quot; as the &quot;quotient of jaws, where the patients 
              enjoy a continuous bridge stability in relation to the total number 
              of jaws treated.&quot; But in the recent report, Adell<sup>2</sup> creates 
              a new definition of &quot;continuous bridge success&quot; by only counting 
              follow-up from time of &quot;prosthesis placement,&quot; to claim that 
              &quot;More than 95% of maxillae had continuous prosthesis stability 
              at 5 and 10 years.&quot; Adell’s recent article reveals that, for implants 
              placed between 1971-1981, the five- and ten-year maxillary bridge success 
              rates were only between 81% and 89% using the definition that was operational 
              in the 1980s. </p>
            <p>FACT #1: Adell, Br&aring;nemark et al.<sup>2</sup> document that "Continuous 
              Bridge Stability" in the maxilla was 81-82% at 10 years, not the 96% 
              at 5-12 years that Nobelpharma's advertisements claim.</p>
            <p>FACT #2 : Adell<sup>2</sup> reports that "survival" was criteria of 
              success with Br&aring;nemark Implants because annual removal of all 
              bridges to confirm osseointegration was considered "too time consuming." 
            </p>
            <p>FACT #3: Adell<sup>2</sup> confirms 13% maxillary-implant fractures 
              at 10 years increasing to 16% at 15 years for 524 Br&aring;nemark Implants 
              placed at Univ. of Gothenburg between 1971-76.</p>
            <p>FACT #4: Adell2 includes "repairable" fractures as successes in order 
              to claim 81-82% success in maxilla at 10 years; 3i<sup>3</sup> sells 
              "Abutment Post for Fractured Br&aring;nemark-type Implants" (catalog 
              #APFB1). </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Nobelpharma’s current advertisements state, among other claims, that, 
              &quot;Unlike some other implants, the Br&aring;nemark System<sup>&reg;1</sup> 
              is supported by numerous long-term clinical studies.&quot; Core-Vent 
              believes that citing the number of studies without evaluating what those 
              studies actually show is a poor method of claiming superiority. In fact, 
              the recently published Adell2 study acknowledges that, &quot;More precise 
              determination as to whether fixtures were osseointegrated could have 
              been achieved if the prostheses were detached annually and individual 
              manual fixture stability tests performed.&quot; The article states that 
              this was considered &quot;too time-consuming.&quot; The study also reveals 
              that 16% of the 524 maxillary fixtures placed between 1971 and 1976 
              had fractured by 15 years (13% by 10 years) with an unknown number of 
              these being carried on the statistics as successful if the broken tops 
              could be smoothed and a longer abutment screw used to attach the bridge 
              to the fractured stump –– &quot;if a fixture had fractured and a sufficiently 
              long apical portion remained, it was repaired, re-used and then registered 
              as stable but fractured.&quot; If one considers the fact that the Gothenburg 
              study failed to test individual fixtures for mobility because it was 
              considered &quot;too time-consuming&quot; and counted fractured implants 
              as successes if they were still stable, this would indicate that the 
              true implant success rates could only be viewed as speculative, and 
              certainly brings into question the veracity of Nobelpharma’s claims 
              that this is &quot;the only clinical implant study that has survived 
              scientific scrutiny.&quot; This demonstrates how success rates can be 
              altered by retrospectively changing the criteria. </p>
            <p>CORE-VENT BELIEVES...THE PROFESSION IS LOOKING FOR BETTER PRODUCTS 
              AT REASONABLE PRICES NOT A BETTER WARRANTY AT HIGHER PRICES</p>
            <p>One of the &quot;FACTS&quot; that Nobelpharma’s recent advertisement 
              asks the profession to weigh is, &quot;Prior to general marketing, Br&aring;nemark 
              System products are tested to verify their effectiveness.&quot; In fact, 
              in 1988, Nobelpharma introduced a &quot;self-tapping, conical fixture&quot; 
              that was referred to in its 1988 and 1989-90 catalogs for use &quot;mainly 
              in the maxilla.&quot; The catalogs make no mention of use of this implant 
              for bone graft cases, but by 1990, Nobelpharma warned its Canadian customers 
              in writing that this implant should &quot;not be used for other than 
              bone grafted cases or unacceptable bone loss may occur.&quot; This implant 
              was eliminated from the 1991 product catalog and is only listed in the 
              &quot;Special Products&quot; catalog selling for 22% more than it could 
              be purchased for in 1990 (5-pack price, no longer available). Nobelpharma 
              also sells a 3.0mm pure titanium fixture, without prior FDA 510k marketing 
              approval. through its &quot;Custom Device&quot; Department. Nobelpharma 
              acknowledges that it is 50% weaker than the standard fixture and, in 
              a disclaimer letter, states that it &quot;has not been included in any 
              short- or long-term clinical evaluations.&quot; It also states that, 
              &quot;Nobelpharma assumes no responsibility with respect to the device’s 
              suitability for its intended or recommended purposes.&quot; In order 
              to circumvent FDA requirements for pre-market approval, Nobelpharma’s 
              disclosure letter falsely states that the 3.0mm fixture, &quot;is one 
              which is manufactured to your specifications to meet the special needs 
              of a named patient.&quot; Since Nobelpharma stocks inventory of this 
              implant, sterile packaged and labeled, it is not a &quot;Custom Device,&quot; 
              as defined by either the FDA or Nobelpharma. </p>
            <p>Nobelpharma has been faced with increasing documentation and professional 
              awareness of complications associated with their products in a number 
              of published studies, referenced here and in conferences such as the 
              &quot;International Conference on the Prevention of Problems, Complications 
              and Failures,&quot; recently held in Malmo, Sweden. On January 1, 1991, 
              Nobelpharma announced the introduction of a 5-year Warranty (effective 
              March 1, 1991). In a special Nobelpharma Update newsletter, Leif Ek, 
              President &amp; CEO, Nobelpharma Sweden, is quoted as saying that, &quot;We 
              can offer this warranty only because the success rates of Br&aring;nemark 
              System treatment are so high.&quot; Considering the price increase that 
              accompanied this warranty announcement and the above referenced research 
              discrepancies, Mr. Ek would probably be correct in substituting the 
              word &quot;prices&quot; for &quot;success rates.&quot;</p>
            <p>This report will also analyze a number of studies and relate them to 
              the design improvements that are incorporated in the Screw-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> 
              and Conical, Self-tapping Swede-Vent&trade; Implants. It also cites 
              research that supports the use of titanium alloy for added strength 
              of both implant and prosthetic components. Core-Vent’s emphasis on abutment 
              strength, precision and rotational stability will also be documented 
              (page 8) by reference to independent studies. We are proud of the distinction 
              of being the most popular implant system (CRA Newsletter, December 1990) 
              as well as being the cost-containment leader, most complete prosthodontic 
              system, and offering the most widely available, reasonably priced education 
              courses (CRA Newsletter, January 1991). </p>

            <p>THE MYTH OF PURE TITANIUM’S EXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP TO SUCCESSFUL OSSEOINTEGRATION 
              HAS COME TO AN END</p>
            <p>Medical grade titanium alloy has been the standard in the orthopedic 
              industry since the early 1970s. As Professor Frank Young, editor of 
              the Journal of Biomaterials, stated in a presentation to the 1988 NIH 
              Consensus Conference on Implants, &quot;Commercially pure titanium has 
              barely adequate (low hardness and tensile strength) mechanical properties 
              for dental implant applications, and although it is a logical starting 
              material, unalloyed metals usually are not found to be optimum...the 
              clinical success of the titanium alloys under relatively crude conditions 
              is remarkable.&quot; </p>
            <p>FACT #5: Zarb<sup>4</sup> reporting on 244 Br&aring;nemark implants 
              documents fractures with 53 gold screws and 9 abutment screws.</p>
            <p>FACT #6: Prof. Young (editor, Journal of Biomaterials) reports at the 
              NIH Implant Consensus Conference that &quot;Commercially pure titanium 
              has barely adequate mechanical properties for dental implant applications.&quot;</p>
            <p>FACT #7: Linder<sup>5</sup> (Swedish) confirms titanium alloy osseointegrates 
              as well as pure titanium.</p>
            <p>FACT #8: Laney<sup>6</sup>, Sones<sup>7</sup> and Desjardins<sup>8</sup> 
              report non retrievability of fractured pure titanium abutment screws 
              resulting in loss of the implant.</p>
            <p>The Screw-Vent Implant was introduced in 1986 in pure titanium, matching 
              the Br&aring;nemark Implant in material, threads and dimensions. It 
              offered design advantages, such as a straight neck that eliminated countersinking 
              and threads to the apex for self-tapping insertion and fixation to cortical 
              bone. Based on the many studies that show equal osseointegration between 
              pure titanium and titanium alloy implants, the Screw-Vent Implant is 
              now also available in medical grade titanium alloy for added strength 
              and to reduce the chance of stripping the internal hex during self-tapping 
              insertion. This medical grade alloy is composed of 90% titanium.</p>
            <p>In an article in the September 1985 issue of the Journal of Prosthetic 
              Dentistry entitled, &quot;Titanium, The Mystery Metal of Implant Dentistry,&quot; 
              Parr et al. state, &quot;Many of the titanium alloys, in which Ti is 
              present in concentrations of 85% to 95%, maintain the passivity of pure 
              titanium...Titanium, both as pure metal and as alloy, is easily passivated 
              forming a stable (TiO2) surface oxide that makes the metal corrosion 
              resistant...The clinical significance of the data is substantiated by 
              more than 20 years of clinical experience with pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V 
              alloys...Ti alloys are extremely resistant to corrosion fatigue making 
              titanium alloy the metal of choice when high corrosion fatigue strength 
              is desired.&quot;</p>
            <p>The Core-Vent<sup>&reg;</sup> Implant, made of medical grade titanium 
              alloy, was introduced in 1982. This implant has proven to be highly 
              successful in achieving and maintaining osseointegration. The five-year 
              study of 1605 Core-Vent implants by Patrick et al., Journal of Oral 
              Implantology, Vol. XV, No. 2, 1989, reports a success rate of 96% for 
              both maxilla and mandible.</p>
            <p>Titanium Alloy Has 60% Greater Tensile Strength Than Pure Titanium</p>
            <p>Swedish Study5 Shows No Difference in Osseointegration Between Pure 
              Titanium and Titanium Alloy </p>
            <p>A study was published in the December 1988 issue of the Journal of 
              Prosthetic Dentistry by Lum and Beirne entitled, &quot;Osseointegration 
              of Two Types of Implants in Nonhuman Primates.&quot; The independent 
              study directly compares the response of the bone to unloaded as well 
              as occlusally loaded Core-Vent and Br&aring;nemark implants at the light 
              microscopic level. Histologic examination revealed that both types of 
              implants achieved osseointegration and maintained the direct contact 
              with bone after five months of being in function. The results were the 
              same after one year as confirmed in a later report in Clinical Dentistry. 
            </p>
            <p>A group of Swedish researchers, Linder at al.<sup>5</sup> (Acta Orthop 
              Scand 1989;60:129-134), reported on the osseointegration of both pure 
              titanium and titanium alloy implants. Their research, conducted in the 
              tibia of rabbits, states that the sections were &quot;...analyzed (histo)morphometrically 
              using a Merz grid to estimate the amount of periosteal and endosteal 
              new bone formation.&quot; In evaluating 76 implants, including 38 pure 
              titanium and 10 titanium alloy implants, only three implants failed 
              to osseointegrate (two were pure titanium and one was stainless steel). 
              The authors concluded that, &quot;With the exception of these three 
              cases, the bony reaction was remarkably consistent.&quot;</p>
            <p>Adell Reports 16% of Br&aring;nemark Implants Fracture in Maxilla</p>
            <p>A study by Adell, Br&aring;nemark et al.<sup>2</sup> (JOMI, Vol. 5, 
              #4, 1990), reporting the &quot;Long-term Follow up Study of Osseointegrated 
              Implants in the Treatment of Totally Edentulous Jaws,&quot; included 
              &quot;Routine Group 1,&quot; consisting of 524 maxillary and 480 mandibular 
              implants placed in edentulous jaws between July 1971 and June 3, 1976. 
              For this group, the study reports an implant fracture rate for the maxilla 
              of 7% at 5 years, 13% at 10 years and 16% at 15 years. The fracture 
              rate was less dramatic in the mandible for this group of patients (4% 
              by 10 years) and for subsequent groups with shorter follow-up periods. 
              Laney<sup>7</sup> (Mayo Clinic) has experienced at least three Br&aring;nemark 
              Implant fractures presumably using the greatest of prosthetic expertise. 
              Implant fractures with the Br&aring;nemark Implant are frequent enough 
              that the 3i<sup>&reg;3</sup> company makes an &quot;Abutment Post for 
              Fractured Br&aring;nemark-type Implants: Catalog No. APFB1). With the 
              increased use of implants in the posterior of partially edentulous jaws 
              and the introduction of Nobelpharma’s new conical abutments that allow 
              overlapping of metal to meet esthetic demands, it is reasonable to assume 
              that the implant will be subjected to increased lateral forces that 
              could result in an increase in the reported level of Br&aring;nemark 
              Implant fractures. Metal fatigue is a function of time as shown by the 
              progressive increase in fracture of pure titanium Br&aring;nemark Implants 
              (see Adell). </p>
            <p>Design Also Contributes to Implant Fractures</p>
            <p>The wider neck of the Br&aring;nemark Implant, a byproduct of the external 
              hex design, requires over 2mm of countersinking in order to place the 
              implant level with the crest of the ridge. An additional 1.5mm of crestal 
              bone loss occurs in the first year in function (Br&aring;nemark et al., 
              Osseointegrated Implants, 1977) due to high stress concentrations for 
              compression on the base of the countersink. With 3.5mm of crestal bone 
              support lost, the weakest part of the implant, the minor diameter of 
              the first thread, is left unsupported by bone and subject to fracture. 
              The fact that so few fractures have been documented with the pure titanium 
              Screw-Vent Implants may be attributed to the fact that, because of its 
              internal Hex-Thread&reg; connection (U.S. Pat. #4,960,381), it was able 
              to be designed with a smaller diameter straight neck. This eliminates 
              the need for countersinking and minimizes crestal bone loss from stress 
              concentrations. The result is that the first thread of the Screw-Vent, 
              where the wall thickness is the least, is more likely to be well buried 
              in bone. It would logically follow that fewer fractures will occur with 
              the &quot;CST&quot; Swede-Vent because its conical neck eliminates the 
              need for countersinking in the maxilla and the first thread of this 
              implant is almost 1mm further apical than on the standard Br&aring;nemark 
              design. </p>
            <p>FACT #9: Laney<sup>6</sup> reports three fractures with Br&aring;nemark 
              Implants placed in lower jaws at Mayo Clinic.</p>
            <p>FACT #10: Br&aring;nemark<sup>9</sup> reports 2mm bone loss from countersinking 
              plus 1.5mm of additional crestal bone loss in first year from stress 
              concentration under wider neck –– 3.5mm total loss. </p>
            <p>FACT #11: Iaccona<sup>10</sup> documents only 0.6-0.8mm of crestal 
              bone loss with Screw-Vent within first year. The internal hex allows 
              narrow neck design eliminating the need for countersinking.</p>
            <p>FACT #12: Laney<sup>6</sup> reports complete failure with Br&aring;nemark 
              Implants in 8 maxillary cases treated at Mayo Clinic; Mito11 documents 
              25% of stable Br&aring;nemark Implants followed at UCLA for 2-3 years 
              lost osseointegration.</p>
            <p>Maxillary Implant Success Rates in Swedish Study May Fail to Meet Albrektsson/Zarb 
              Criteria of 85% at 5 Years and 80% at 10 years (JOMI, Vol. 1, 1986)</p>
            <p>Adell et al.2 document 5- and 10-year results for what they termed 
              &quot;Routine Group II&quot; implants placed in Gothenburg between July 
              1976 and June 1981. With 394 maxillary implants, the 5- and 10-year 
              implant survival rates were 89% and 82% respectively. Implant survival 
              was the actual criterion of success, not osseointegration, as evidenced 
              by the authors’ acknowledgement that bridges were not removed annually 
              to conduct &quot;individual manual fixture stability tests.&quot; Furthermore, 
              an unknown number of fractured fixtures were being counted as successes. 
              Based on these factors, the actual success rates are speculative.</p>
            <p>Implant Design Can Affect Initial Stability and Increase Clinical Success 
              in the Maxilla</p>
            <p>Adell<sup>2</sup> states that &quot;The only cortical reinforcement 
              to initially support the fixtures was frequently the cortical lining 
              of the nose or the maxillary sinus. With these quantitative and qualitative 
              maxillary deficiencies, it is surprising that the survival rates for 
              prostheses and fixtures were so positive.&quot; The Conical Neck, Self-Tapping 
              CST Swede-Vent and the Screw-Vent, with its straight neck, both take 
              this factor into consideration by eliminating the need for a bone tapping 
              instrument to cut the threads to engage cortical bone under the nose 
              and sinus. Countersinking is not required with the Screw-Vent in the 
              maxilla, thus preserving crestal cortical bone and further adding to 
              initial stability.</p>
            <p>HA Coating Increases Bone-Implant Contact During the Critical First 
              Year</p>
            <p>Implants fail to osseointegrate if movement occurs during the submerged 
              healing period. They lose osseointegration, once placed in function, 
              if inadequate bone-to-metal interface has been established to withstand 
              occlusal loading. Of course, cortical bone is better able to provide 
              stability for the implant and should be engaged wherever possible, preferably 
              by threads. Adell<sup>2</sup> confirms that the majority of implant 
              failures due to loss of osseointegration takes place in the first year 
              following insertion. A study conducted at UCLA (Mito; 1989 CDA Journal) 
              documents that 25% of the Br&aring;nemark Implants placed in the maxilla 
              and followed for 24-36 months lost osseointegration after initially 
              having been diagnosed as stable. All the losses occurred in the first 
              six months following prosthetic attachment.</p>
            <p>Gottlander’s<sup>13</sup> doctoral thesis, University of Gothenburg, 
              demonstrates the establishment of more complete attachment of bone to 
              the HA coated surface of an implant in the first six weeks following 
              placement in rabbits. These results, histologically comparing coated 
              and uncoated titanium implants in rabbits, are reported, but misinterpreted, 
              in a recent issue of Nobelpharma News (Vol. 4, #3, 1990). The chart 
              contained in the article clearly shows about 55-90% (median = 72%) surface 
              contact with HA coated implants at six weeks compared to only 30-70% 
              (median = 50%) with titanium alone. The author is quoted as referring 
              to this 22% difference in the median at six weeks as &quot;statistically 
              insignificant.&quot; On the other hand, the chart shows one-year results 
              of approximately 40-75% contact for the HA coated implants (median = 
              67%) for titanium alone. Gottlander is quoted by Nobelpharma News as 
              claiming that this median difference of only 10% at one year in favor 
              of titanium is &quot;significantly higher.&quot;</p>
            <p>It appears to be misleading for Gottlander to conclude that a median 
              difference of 22% in favor of the HA coated implant at six weeks was 
              &quot;statistically insignificant&quot; while claiming that a median 
              difference of only 10% in favor of the titanium uncoated implant at 
              one year was significant. The headlines of the article in the newspaper 
              of Nobelpharma, a company selling only pure titanium implants, state 
              that &quot;Dr. Magnus Gottlander, M.D., has proven hydroxylapatite to 
              be ineffective in strengthening and making an implant-bone bond form 
              more substantially.&quot; This statement is false and misleading since 
              Gottlander’s study, as reported by Nobelpharma News, did not measure 
              push-out strength differences, only percentage of bone contact. Cook<sup>14</sup> 
              and others have studied attachment strengths and found HA to have significant 
              advantages. Gottlander and Nobelpharma have missed the potential clinical 
              significance of increasing the percentage of bone contact during the 
              critical early healing and loading periods. This is especially true 
              in the porous bone of the maxilla, where Adell<sup>2</sup>, Mito<sup>11</sup>, 
              Jaffin<sup>12</sup> and others have now clearly demonstrated it is a 
              problem area for the pure titanium, screw implants of the Br&aring;nemark 
              design (wide neck, no apical threads). In Type IV bone, Jaffin documents 
              44% failure with Br&aring;nemark fixtures in the maxilla and 37% in 
              the posterior mandible. The article states, &quot;Diagnosis of Type 
              IV bone is usually made at osteotomy. By this time, the tentative restorative 
              treatment plan has usually been decided.&quot; Based on this, it is 
              logical to routinely select implant designs (self-tapping with apical 
              threads) and material (HA coating) that enhance initial stability in 
              these areas of higher risk.</p>
            <p>FACT #13: Adell<sup>2</sup> acknowledges that &quot;cortical lining 
              of nose and maxillary sinus may be only initial support.&quot; Screw-Vent 
              and CST Swede-Vent Implants, with self tapping apical threads, engage 
              cortical bone in maxilla which enhances stability.</p>
            <p>FACT #14: Jaffin and Berman<sup>12</sup> report excessive loss of Br&aring;nemark 
              fixtures (44%) in Type IV (low density trabecular) bone in maxilla.</p>
            <p>FACT #15: Gottlander<sup>13</sup> reports more early bone to-implant 
              contact with HA coating; Cook14 reports increased attachment strength 
              with HA: both should increase success in maxilla. </p>
            <p>This review of the research makes a compelling argument for the design 
              and material concepts that are incorporated in the Screw-Vent titanium 
              alloy implant available with HA coating. For those surgical specialists 
              whose referring dentists are trained to use an external hex implant, 
              the CST Swede-Vent in pure titanium, with or without HA coating, offers 
              many of the design advantages of the Screw-Vent. The Veterans Administration 
              has selected the Spectra-System&trade; exclusively to be included in 
              its prospective, multi-center study of 680 patients. This study will 
              be monitored by external and internal peer review committees to assure 
              strict adherence to the protocol and accurate reporting of the results. 
              Core-Vent Corporation’s confidence in its products is evidenced by its 
              financial support for this study, estimated to cost approximately $23 
              million in total direct and indirect costs. We are prepared to let the 
              facts speak for themselves –– just as we have done in this analysis 
              of the Br&aring;nemark System&reg;1 and other relevant research.</p>
            <p>Compare Prosthetic Systems for Precision, Strength and</p>
            <p>Rotational Stability</p>
            <p>Jemt<sup>15</sup> reports on 23 Br&aring;nemark implants used for single 
              tooth replacements –– 13 become unstable in the first year in function 
              (3 of these become unstable more than once). </p>
            <p>Ohrnell, Br&aring;nemark et al.16 report &quot;a very common problem 
              is loosening of the center screw which leads to a loose abutment and 
              rotation of the crown.&quot; They proposed lengthening the external 
              hex from 0.7mm to 1.2mm to overcome this loosening (Screw-Vent has a 
              1.7mm internal hex –– US Pat #4,960,381). </p>
            <p>Barzilay17 compares prosthetic stability with Nobelpharma (120 microns 
              rotation between mating hexes) and Swede-Vent with zero rotation due 
              to its Taper Lock&trade; design (Pat. Pend.). </p>
            <p>McGlumphy<sup>18</sup> compares Swede Vent abutments to Nobelpharma’s 
              and finds Swede-Vent 30% stronger.</p>
            <p>Binon<sup>19</sup> compares precision between implant and abutment 
              for Nobelpharma, 3i and Swede-Vent components –– Swede-Vent was best 
              at only 14µ of gap vs. Nobelpharma with 49µ.</p>
