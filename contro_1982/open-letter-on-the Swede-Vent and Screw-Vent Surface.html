                <p>SWEDE-VENT AND SCREW-VENT OFFER BR&Aring;NEMARK’S PATENTED SURFACE</p>
                <p> Br&aring;nemark’s U.S. Patent No. 4,330,891 granted in 1982 states, 
                  &quot;An analysis of jaw implants in homo [showed that] the bio-optimal 
                  result [could be achieved using] a biologically flawless material with 
                  a porous (i.e. micro-pitted) surface intended to face the tissue.&quot;</p>
                <p>The Swede-Vent and Screw-Vent pure titanium implants from Core-Vent 
                  Corporation, ACCORDING TO AN INDEPENDENT EXPERT NOMINATED BY NOBELPHARMA, 
                  do provide the type of micro-pitted surface specified in Br&aring;nemark’s 
                  patent. According to Br&aring;nemark’s statements under oath to the 
                  U.S. Patent Office, this surface will provide, &quot;inextricable anchoring 
                  in the living bone tissue.&quot; Core-Vent instituted acid etching procedures 
                  in 1986 and, during the last three years, has conducted extensive tests 
                  using SEM, EDAX and Auger analysis, and built its own Class 10,000 Clean 
                  Room facility in an attempt to perfect the cleaning process and provide 
                  the profession with a &quot;biologically flawless&quot; or superclean 
                  surface.</p>
                <p>NOBELPHARMA FUNDED STUDY CONFIRMS ADVANTAGES OF ACID ETCHING SURFACE</p>
                <p>Taussig Metallurgical Engineers Report #74305-1/August 27, 1987 (copies 
                  available from Core Vent Corporation), examined Nobelpharma implants 
                  that &quot;had been packaged in sealed glass containers&quot; with &quot;a 
                  representative of the Br&aring;nemark Company being present.&quot; Examination 
                  using &quot;scanning electron microscope and Energy Dispersion X-ray 
                  Analysis of two samples representing titanium dental implants&quot; 
                  revealed the following:</p>
                <p>&#9;It appeared that the grinding of the surface of the implant produced 
                  a number of titanium particles that were partially dislodged, and/or 
                  folded over onto the surface of the implant.</p>
                <p>&#9;Energy Dispersion X-ray Analysis of this dark appearing particle 
                  revealed that the primary element was lead. in addition, there was a 
                  significant amount of tin. Other elements present were silicon, aluminum, 
                  magnesium and iron. </p>
                <p>&#9;This particle is primarily a piece of silicon and magnesium oxide.</p>
                <p>&#9;This particle is primarily iron.</p>
                <p>&#9;Machined titanium surfaces are not metallurgically satisfactory 
                  and can detract from the suitability of the implants for service.</p>
                <p>The report by Taussig Metallurgical Engineers strongly recommended 
                  to Nobelpharma to wash their implants in acid (passivation) to &quot;eat 
                  out any metallic particles.&quot; </p>
                <p>THE NOBELPHARMA SURFACE ANALYSIS REPORT CONCLUDED:</p>
                <p>&#9;Br&aring;nemark implants exhibited evidence of nonmetallic particles 
                  on the surface of the implants while the implant had been sealed in 
                  glass containers.</p>
                <p>&#9;Even though the implants have been rendered biologically sterile, 
                  the contamination of the metal surface by metallic particles had resulted 
                  in the implants being not sterile from a metallurgical point of view.</p>
                <p>&#9;It is our opinion that the metallic particles and nonmetallic particles 
                  that we observed on the Br&aring;nemark Implant surfaces as well as 
                  the numerous areas where the apparently ground surfaces have been folded 
                  over, are not metallurgically satisfactory and can detract from the 
                  suitability of the implants for service. </p>
                <p>&#9;The titanium surface can be and should be passivated (i.e. acid 
                  washed –– explanation added) similar to that process performed on stainless 
                  steel to eat out any metallic particles and to help reinforce the passive 
                  oxide film on the surface of the titanium.</p>
                <p>&#9;The dentist, periodontist or oral surgeon has every right to expect 
                  that the surfaces of the implants that they are inserting are clean 
                  and free from any particles that could possibly adversely affect the 
                  serviceability of that implant.</p>
                <p>THE CORE-VENT ANALYSIS CONFIRMS ETCHED SURFACE IS &quot;METALLURGICALLY 
                  IMPROVED&quot;</p>
                <p>Taussig Laboratories recently evaluated Core-Vent Corporations’s cleaning 
                  procedures and concluded: "The general surface appearance of the Core-Vent, 
                  Screw-Vent and Swede-Vent Implants, in our opinion, appear to be metallurgically 
                  improved over that of the Br&aring;nemark implants previously examined 
                  for Nobelpharma by our laboratory because the surface has been chemically 
                  passivated (acid etched) to &quot;eat out&quot; any embedded metal particles. 
                  The surface of the Nobelpharma Implant is machined which causes microscopic 
                  machining laps. These laps fold over metal particles and adhere these 
                  particles to the implant surface." </p>
                <p>The acid etching procedure used to clean the machined surfaces of the 
                  Screw-Vent and Swede-Vent implants increases the number of micro-pits 
                  in the 1-3 micron range. This is the important range Br&aring;nemark’s 
                  patent claims was shown by his research to &quot;approach the order 
                  of magnitude of the cell diameter&quot; and give &quot;operation results&quot; 
                  that were &quot;noticeably improved.&quot;</p>
                <p>SURFACE CONTAMINATION MAY BE CAUSE OF &quot;SECONDARY FAILURE OF OSSEOINTEGRATION&quot;</p>
                <p>Albrektsson, in an article in Dental Clinics of North America, January 
                  1986, stated: "Secondary failure of osseointegration, when a primarily 
                  achieved bone anchorage is lost, sometimes years after insertion, may 
                  depend on a slight incompatibility of the used material, an unsuitable 
                  surface finish of the implant or an overloading." </p>
