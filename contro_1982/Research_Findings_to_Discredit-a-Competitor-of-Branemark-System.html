                </font></b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
                <p>Your readers have been misled by information contained in two articles 
                  in the Vol 2, No. 1, 1987 issue of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial 
                  Implants. The first article that I take issue with is entitled, &quot;Force 
                  Transfer by Osseointegrated Implant Devices,&quot; by Mark E. Kinni, 
                  Stephanie N. Hokama, and Angelo A. Caputo. I question the validity of 
                  this research technique because the correlation between two-dimensional 
                  stress tests in plastic and force distribution three dimensionally in 
                  bone has yet to be proven. In fact, photo-elastic stress tests have 
                  been made archaic by three-dimensional finite element analysis. One 
                  of the basic principles of implant design is that an increase in surface 
                  area will result in a corresponding decrease of stress at the interface. 
                  I viewed with suspicion the color pictures in Figures 7, 8 and 9, which 
                  represented that the solid Biotes screw implant with a 3.75mm outside 
                  thread diameter could distribute stress better than the hollow-vented 
                  Core-Vent implant with a 6.3mm outside thread diameter (5.5mm major 
                  diameter). I spoke with Dr. Caputo on March 16. He admitted, when questioned 
                  about the difference in stress patterns between the large Core-Vent 
                  implant in Figures 9 and 10 that, in fact, the picture in Figure 9 was 
                  taken at 30 lbs. of load while that in figure 10 was taken at 40 lbs. 
                  This surprised me since the article represented that all pictures were 
                  taken at 40 lbs. of load. He explained that, in this study, the pictures 
                  were taken at 10, 20, 30 and 40 lbs of load. Dr. Caputo refused to show 
                  me the different loading pictures to verify that the pictures of the 
                  Biotes implant showing minimal stress concentration were taken with 
                  the same amount of load as the Core-Vent implants.</p>
                <p>I think it is important to note that Figure 5 examining the &quot;unstressed 
                  models&quot; shows the full length of the Biotes and Core-Vent implants. 
                  Figure 6, showing &quot;stress patterns observed with 40 lb. axial load&quot; 
                  cropped the top of the picture of the Biotes implant while it shows 
                  the full length of the Core-Vent implant. In fact, none of the figures 
                  show the top of the Biotes implants under stress. The Biotes implant, 
                  which is wider at the top, will result in undesirable high stress concentrations 
                  in the area of the crest of the ridge. Several questions raised by this 
                  study are:</p>
                <p>&#9;1. Why did this study fail to accurately report the load under 
                  which the implants were placed at the time the pictures were taken?</p>
                <p>&#9;2. Why were the stress concentrations at the top of the Biotes 
                  implant deliberately omitted from the pictures?</p>
                <p>The second article which I question is entitled, &quot;Comparative 
                  Surface Analysis of Two Osseointegrated Implant Systems,&quot; by Dr. 
                  Patrick J. Henry. Dr. Henry’s conclusion that Core Vent’s 6Al/4V titanium 
                  alloy (approximately 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium and 90% titanium) has, 
                  in fact, up to 7% iron and less than 2.57% aluminum is neither rational 
                  nor correct. The titanium alloy used in Core-Vent implant is manufactured 
                  to the very strict chemistry outlined by the American Society for Testing 
                  and Materials specifications #ASTM F 136-84. A certified chemistry report 
                  accompanies each invoice of alloy purchased by Core-Vent Corporation. 
                  The 1985 and 1986 purchases show an iron content of 0.18% and aluminum 
                  content of 6.24-6.34% (documentation available from Core-Vent Corporation). 
                  Further, Dr. Henry’s article admits that both implants were tested &quot;in 
                  the condition supplied by the manufacturer.&quot; At the time of his 
                  testing, Core-Vent was providing the implant with a prescribed cleaning 
                  procedure to be performed by the dentist while the Biotes implant was 
                  provided pre-cleaned in titanium tubes. Core-Vent now provides its implant 
                  pre-packaged, as well. Dr. Henry’s surface analysis comparisons, therefore, 
                  are not only inaccurate, but also intentionally unfair. A simple washing 
                  with hard tap water cold increase the calcium, silicone and iron content 
                  on the surface of the implant. Core-Vent implants and Biotes implants 
                  have been tested by S. E. A. L. Laboratories in Los Angeles using Auger 
                  analysis, which is approximately 250 times more definitive than the 
                  EDAX testing procedure used by Dr. Henry. The results show the surface 
                  of Core-Vent’s alloy and Biotes’ commercially pure titanium were almost 
                  identical with no trace of iron or aluminum appearing on the surface 
                  of either material (documentation available from Core-Vent Corporation).</p>
                <p>Dr. Henry has agreed to send 5 of the implants that he has tested directly 
                  to Dr. Frank Young, Chairman of the Department of Biomaterials at the 
                  University of South Carolina and editor of the Journal of Biomaterials. 
                  Dr. Henry and I will receive the analysis report from Dr. Young and 
                  I am sure it will confirm Dr. Henry’s misreading of the surface of the 
                  Core-Vent implant and inappropriate extrapolation of this information 
                  to his estimate of the bulk alloy. </p>
                <p>Dr. Henry’s article further compares the grit-blasted surface of the 
                  Core-Vent implant to that of the smoother machined surface of the Biotes 
                  implant and, through references to four articles written by Br&aring;nemark 
                  and his co-workers, tries to prove the superiority of the smoother surface. 
                  One only has to read the article in this same issue of the JOMI by Steven 
                  D. Cook et al., in which reference is made to a previous article by 
                  Cook (J Biomed Mater Res 1985;19:875-901) proving that osseointegration 
                  was more likely to occur on a grit-blasted surface than on a smooth 
                  surface.</p>
                <p>I would suggest that, in future issues of the JOMI, it would be in 
                  the profession’s best interest if articles purporting to unbiasedly 
                  compare two competing systems, be viewed with skepticism. In the editorial 
                  entitled, &quot;Implantology ‘86&quot; that also appeared in the same 
                  issue of JOMI, Dr. Laskin stated, &quot;It is understandable that manufacturers 
                  praise their own products, but we would hope that we can at least turn 
                  to our professional colleagues for a less biased appraisal. Unfortunately, 
                  this, too, does not seem to be the answer at the present time.&quot;</p>
                <p>Furthermore, it is also unfortunate that we cannot rely on our scientific 
                  journals for proper screening of inaccurate and biased reports.</p>
