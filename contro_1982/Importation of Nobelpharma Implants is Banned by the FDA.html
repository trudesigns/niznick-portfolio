            <p align="CENTER">Reprint of FDA Letter to Nobelpharma AB [now Nobel Biocare] 
              from</p>
            <p align="CENTER">Carol Shirk, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with 
              Preface by Dr. Niznick</p>
            </b>  
            <p>The FDA, in its February 21 1992 Warning Letter to Nobelpharma AB, 
              Sweden, ruled that, due to serious violations in Good Manufacturing 
              Practices (GMP), Nobelpharma’s endosseous implants shall be banned from 
              importation into the United States. The FDA Warning Letter states that 
              this ban will remain in effect until Nobelpharma provides an adequate 
              written response to the charges and the FDA has an opportunity to conduct 
              another inspection of the Swedish facilities to verify the implementation 
              of the corrections. Due to Nobelpharma USA’s lack of candor with its 
              customers, the full text of the FDA Warning Letter is being sent to 
              you. Nobelpharma’s response letter to its customers failed to even mention 
              that it is banned from shipping endosseous implants to the United States 
              for an indeterminate period of time. </p>
            <p>Nobelpharma’s response letter characterizes their 11 serious violations 
              to GMPs as &quot;suggestions by the FDA.&quot; It acknowledges the FDA’s 
              criticism of &quot;the Company’s sterilization procedures,&quot; but 
              attempts to explain this away by stating that this is because Nobelpharma’s 
              procedures &quot;are generally unfamiliar to the FDA, but widely used 
              in Europe.&quot; In 1989, Nobelpharma’s Swedish manufacturing plant 
              and corporate headquarters received its first inspection by the FDA. 
              Nobelpharma’s corporate management at Gothenburg was issued a control 
              of the dry heat sterilization process.&quot; At that time, it was noted 
              that &quot;management promised corrective action&quot; and that &quot;product 
              may have to be refused entrance into the U.S.&quot; Nobelpharma apparently 
              failed to undertake the required corrective action regarding sterility 
              controls. Nobelpharma’s letter to its customers further asserts that 
              &quot;none of the FDA inspectional observations in any way called into 
              serious question the safety or efficacy of the FDA to protect the public 
              from unsafe products.&quot; Now that the profession is aware of Nobelpharma’s 
              serious violations of GMPs and the resulting ban on importation of its 
              implants, the profession should consider the potential medical/legal 
              liability from use of Nobelpharma’s implants in the absence of full 
              disclosure and proper informed consent from their patients. A partial 
              list of Nobelpharma’s GMP violations is listed below:</p>
            <p>&#9;FAILURE #2: –– &quot;Failure to establish adequate written procedures 
              describing any processing controls...there are no procedures for, nor 
              documentation of, the ampoule inspection prior to any of the sterilization 
              processes, and after the dry heat sterilization.&quot;</p>
            <p>&#9;FAILURE #5 –– &quot;Failure to investigate, after a device has 
              been released for distribution, any failure of that device or any of 
              its components to meet performance specifications.&quot;</p>
            <p>&#9;FAILURE #7 –– &quot;Failure to immediately review, evaluate, investigate, 
              and to maintain in a separate portion of the complaint pertaining to 
              injury, death, or any other hazard to safety.&quot; </p>
            <p>&#9;FAILURE #10 –– &quot;Failure to establish adequate written procedures 
              for warehouse control and distribution of finished devices to assure 
              that only those devices approved for release are distributed.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>&#9;FAILURE #11 –– &quot;Failure to provide device packaging and shipping 
              containers that are designed and constructed to protect the device from 
              alteration or damage during customary conditions of distribution...709 
              complaints were received during the past year.&quot;</p>
            <p>In light of the FDA’s Warning Letter, all dentists using implant devices 
              might question the quality control standards that exist in the industry. 
              Core-Vent Bio-Engineering manufactures the Spectra System&reg; and Swede-Vent&reg; 
              Implant in full GMP compliance including conducting the stringent testing 
              requirements for obtaining 510(k) authorization to market abutments. 
              Nobelpharma USA was sent an FDA Warning Letter in August 22, 1991 for 
              selling an implant device without 510(k) authorization and for failure 
              to report implant fractures to the FDA. In the most recent Warning Letter 
              to Nobelpharma Sweden, reference is also made to restriction of sale 
              of certain products in the US that do not have 510(k) market authorization.</p>

            <p>&#9;REGISTERED MAIL –– RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED</p>
            <p>&#9;WARNING LETTER</p>
            <p>February 21, 1992</p>
            <p>Mr. Mats Pettersson</p>
            <p>President</p>
            <p>Nobelpharma AB</p>
            <p>Bohusgatan 15</p>
            <p>Gothenburg, S-40226 Sweden</p>
            <p>Dear Mr. Petterson:</p>
            <p>During an inspection of your manufacturing facilities located at Dimbovagen 
              2, Karlskoga, Sweden, and Bohusgatan 15, Gothenburg, Sweden, on November 
              11 through 13, 1991, our investigator observed conditions which may 
              contribute to serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
              Act (the Act) and deviations from implementing regulations as follows:</p>
            <p>1.&#9;Failure to establish adequate procedures for specification control 
              measures to assure that the design basis for the device is correctly 
              translated into approved specifications, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). 
              For example, the dry heat sterilization process has not been adequately 
              validated and documented to support the use of parametric release.</p>
            <p>2.&#9;Failure to establish adequate written procedures describing any 
              processing controls necessary to assure conformance to applicable specifications, 
              and conduct all process control operations in a manner designed to assure 
              that the device conforms to applicable specifications, as required by 
              21 CFR 820.100(b) (1) and (2). For example, there are no procedures 
              for, nor documentation of, the ampoule inspection prior to any of the 
              sterilization processes, and after the dry heat sterilization. About 
              309 complaints regarding ampoule breakage were received in the past 
              year.</p>
            <p>3.&#9;Failure to maintain a device history record which demonstrates 
              that the device is manufactured in accordance with the device master 
              record, as required by CFR 820.184. For example, sterilizer loads in 
              the dry heat oven have exceeded the maximum load defined in the established 
              procedures, i.e., batch 506132 and 504572, and time/temperature for 
              each cycle is not recorded in the sterilization control log as required. 
            </p>
            <p>4.&#9;Failure to maintain a critical device history record which contains 
              or refers to the location of the inspection checks performed, the methods 
              and equipment used, results, the date and signature of the inspecting 
              individual, as required by 21 CFR 820.185(c). For example:</p>
            <p>&#9;a.&#9;Product received under work order numbers 580483, 520091 
              and 520093 from the contract sterilizer were released without the required 
              documentation of inspection and review.</p>
            <p>&#9;b.&#9;The device history records for work order numbers 502737, 
              and 502981 fail to document the performance of critical device inspections 
              and the signature of the inspecting individual(s).</p>
            <p>5.&#9;Failure to investigate, after a device has been released for 
              distribution, any failure of that device or any of its components to 
              meet performance specifications, and maintain a written record of any 
              failure investigation, including conclusions and follow-up, as required 
              by 21 CFR 820.162. For example:</p>
            <p>&#9;a.&#9;The procedure for returned goods does not provide for review 
              and evaluation to determine if a failure investigation should be conducted.</p>
            <p>&#9;b.&#9;There are no records to demonstrate that failure investigations 
              have been performed.</p>
            <p>&#9;c.&#9;&quot;Quality Messages&quot; issued to Nobelpharma subsidiaries 
              identify product defects for distributed products, but there is no record 
              of the investigation, to include conclusions and follow-up.</p>
            <p>6.&#9;Failure to establish written procedures for any reprocessing 
              associated with the production of a critical device or component that 
              provides for equipment to be used, any special quality assurance methods 
              or tests, determination and documentation of the effect of constant 
              reprocessing on a device or a component, and written testing and sampling 
              procedures for any critical device or component subject to reprocessing 
              to assure conformity to the original, or subsequently modified, and 
              approved specifications, as required by 21 CFR 820.116. For example, 
              there are no procedures for, nor documentation of, the rework/resterilization 
              of the ampoules, no retesting is performed, and there is no documentation 
              to demonstrate that the rework does not adversely affect the product.</p>
            <p>7.&#9;Failure to immediately review, evaluate, investigate, and to 
              maintain in a separate portion of the complaint pertaining to injury, 
              death, or any other hazard to safety, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(b). 
              For example, complaints pertaining to injury are not reviewed and evaluated 
              in a timely manner, and are not maintained in a separate portion of 
              the complaint file.</p>
            <p>8.&#9;Failure to maintain a record of the reason and the name of the 
              individual responsible for the decision not to investigate written and 
              oral complaints, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a). For example, when 
              an investigation is not performed, the reason and person responsible 
              for making the decision not to investigate are not documented.</p>
            <p>9.&#9;Failure to subject specification changes to controls as stringent 
              as those applied to the original design specifications of the device, 
              have such changes approved and documented by a designated individual(s), 
              and include approval date and the date the change becomes effective, 
              as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(2). For example, the recent change 
              in specifications for the endosseous implant [INFORMATION CENSORED] 
              packaging, due to the change to steam sterilization, has not been validated, 
              and there is no documentation of the approval of this change.</p>
            <p>10.&#9;Failure to establish adequate written procedures for warehouse 
              control and distribution of finished devices to assure that only those 
              devices approved for release are distributed, as required by 21 CFR 
              820.150. For example, accepted product was stored in process/unaccepted 
              product.</p>
            <p>11.&#9;Failure to provide device packaging and shipping containers 
              that are designed and constructed to protect the device from alteration 
              or damage during customary conditions of distribution, as required by 
              21 CFR 820.130. For example, 709 complaints were received during the 
              past year, the majority of which were for receipt of broken ampoules 
              which contain the sterile endosseous devices.</p>
            <p>Review of our records indicates that you have not submitted any premarket 
              notification 510(k) for the [INFORMATION CENSORED]. Promotion and distribution 
              of this device without submission of a premarket notification may result 
              in the device being misbranded in accordance with Section 502(o) of 
              the Act.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Therefore, you are hereby notified to discontinue any further distribution 
              of the subject device in the United States. The [INFORMATION CENSORED] 
              will be refused entry into the United States until your firm has received 
              a 510(k) clearance from the FDA.</p>
            <p>Questions regarding the submission of a premarket notification 510(k) 
              should be directed to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center 
              for Devices and Radiological Health (HFZ-403), 1390 Piccard Drive, Rockville, 
              Maryland 20850, phone (301) 427-1190.</p>
            <p>The above identification of violations is not intended to be an all-inclusive 
              list of deficiencies at your facility. It is your responsibility to 
              ensure that all products manufactured, distributed, held, and labeled 
              by your firm are in compliance with the provisions of the Act.</p>
            <p>Given the serious nature of these violations of the Act, all endosseous 
              implants manufactured by Nobelpharma AB, Bohusgatan 15, Gothenburg, 
              Sweden, and Nobelpharma Produktion AB, Dimbovagen 2, Karlskoga, Sweden, 
              will be refused entry into the United States until these violations 
              are corrected. Until these violations are corrected, Federal agencies 
              will be informed that the FDA recommends against the award of contracts 
              for affected products.</p>
            <p>In order to remove the devices from this detention, it will be necessary 
              for you to provide written response to the charges in this Warning Letter 
              for our review. After we notify you that the response is adequate, it 
              will be your responsibility to schedule another inspection of your facility. 
              As soon as this inspection has taken place, and the implementation of 
              your corrections has been verified, your products may resume entry into 
              this country.</p>
            <p>Please advise us in writing as to the specific actions taken, or intended 
              to be taken, to correct these deficiencies. We acknowledge receipt of 
              your January 21, 1992, letter in response to the inspection, and you 
              may refer to it in your response to this letter. Please include any 
              and all documentation to show that adequate correction has been achieved. 
              In the case of future corrections, an estimated date of completion, 
              and documentation showing plans for correction, should be included with 
              your response to this letter. To expedite our review, please include 
              an English translation of the supporting documentation with your response. 
              Please address any questions to: </p>
