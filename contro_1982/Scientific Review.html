                <p>A recent article in the inaugural issue of the International Journal 
                  of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants purports to be a review of dental 
                  implants currently used. The authors — T. Albrektsson, G. Zarb, P. Worthington, 
                  and A. Eriksson — admit to &quot;a certain degree of bias&quot; [toward 
                  the Br&aring;nemark System]. In fact, the article itself is a paper 
                  read by Dr. Worthington in Vancouver on Tuesday, May 20, 1986, at a 
                  marketing meeting sponsored by Nobelpharma USA, Inc., distributors of 
                  the Br&aring;nemark System. This article not only chronicles the climb 
                  up the ladder from scientific research toward applied biotechnology, 
                  but also clearly demonstrates the attempts by some to pull the ladder 
                  up behind them. This letter, in response to the Albrektsson et al. article, 
                  reveals for the first time the results of the first four years of the 
                  University of Toronto Br&aring;nemark System Replication Study under 
                  the direction of Dr. George Zarb. This information has never been published 
                  and was only produced pursuant to legal discovery in Core-Vent Corporation’s 
                  litigation with Nobelpharma.</p>
                <p>I believe it is crucial that the facts be made clear, that obvious 
                  misstatements in the published article be corrected, and that you, the 
                  clinician, be given the truth about an article that is currently being 
                  used by Nobelpharma USA, Inc., primarily as a widely distributed marketing 
                  tool. The following is a Letter to the Editor submitted for publication 
                  in the International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants. </p>
                <p>TO THE EDITOR:</p>
                <p>The first volume of your journal contained an article by Albrektsson, 
                  Zarb, Worthington and Eriksson entitled, &quot;The Long Term Efficacy 
                  of Currently Used Dental Implants,&quot; in which the authors acknowledged 
                  &quot;a certain degree of bias&quot; toward the Br&aring;nemark System. 
                  This was made abundantly clear by the unfair and inaccurate evaluation 
                  of the Core-Vent System and the representation of the success of the 
                  Br&aring;nemark System. Here are a few examples:</p>
                <p>1.&#9;STATEMENT: &quot;No results from animal experiments with the 
                  Core-Vent Implant have been found in the literature. A histological 
                  section from a canine implant published in the booklet from the Core-Vent 
                  Corporation demonstrates a patchy contact between the alloy and bone 
                  tissue.&quot;</p>
                <p>FACT:&#9;#9; The &quot;booklet&quot; referred to is a reprint of my published 
                  article (Oral Implantology, Vol. XII, No. 1, 1986) which references 
                  research by Lum and Beirne first published in abstract form and later 
                  in the J of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, June, 1986. The abstract 
                  stated: &quot;All specimens demonstrated new bone growth in the core, 
                  vents and at the interface without soft tissue interposition.&quot; 
                  The published article further confirmed that &quot;the bone metal interface 
                  involved almost the entire surface of the embedded implant.&quot;</p>
                <p>2.&#9;STATEMENT: The authors acknowledge a published abstract of 100 
                  consecutively inserted Core-Vent Implants by Lubar and Katin, but failed 
                  to mention that 98% achieved osseointegration and maintained it for 
                  the two-year observation period. The authors chose to give no credence 
                  to this report, stating, &quot;Nor were the parameters for implant success 
                  properly defined.&quot;</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>FACT:&#9;#9; Lubar and Katin clearly defined their parameters for implant 
                  success:</p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;Preliminary results appear to show that the Core-Vent Implant 
                  achieves a state of osseointegration on a highly consistent basis. It 
                  shows osseointegration as evidenced by the absence of a peri-implant 
                  radiolucency and by the lack of clinical mobility. </p>
                <p>3.&#9;STATEMENT: The authors make reference to two of my articles and 
                  state, &quot;It has been repeatedly claimed that equally good results 
                  will be achieved with the Core-Vent Implant as with the Br&aring;nemark 
                  Screw Implant.&quot;</p>
                <p>FACT:&#9;The first reference cited was a Letter to the Editor (Journal 
                  of Prosthetic Dentistry, Vol 52, No. 1, 1983) which makes no statements 
                  regarding the clinical success of either the Core Vent or Br&aring;nemark 
                  implants. In the second article (Oral Implantology, Vol XII, No. 1, 
                  1986), I contrasted the two-year results of Lubar, who reported 96% 
                  success (functioning, osseointegrated implants) with the Br&aring;nemark 
                  System (Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry, Vol. 50, No. 2, 1983). Although 
                  these reports are short-term, the Albrektsson et al. article confirmed 
                  that: </p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;Any implant losses after the first one to two years of function 
                  seem to be unlikely, provided osseointegration has occurred. [Article 
                  reference: Br&aring;nemark, P-I: Personal communication, 1986].</p>
                <p>It was also noted in my article that the implants in Lubar’s study 
                  had been used in the anterior and posterior of both arches, free standing, 
                  splinted to other implants, and splinted to natural teeth –– whereas 
                  the Br&aring;nemark implant were placed only in the symphysis of the 
                  edentulous jaw.</p>
                <p>4.&#9;STATEMENT: The authors propose yet another definition of osseointegration. 
                  Throughout the first seventeen years of Br&aring;nemark’s research, 
                  only one definition of osseointegration was in existence. In the last 
                  three years, however, the number of definitions and qualifications of 
                  this interfacial phenomenon seems to be increasing in direct proportion 
                  to the increase in popularity of the Core-Vent System.</p>
                <p>The 1984 definition (JOMS Vol. 42, No. 8) was &quot;contact on the 
                  light microscopic level between living bone tissue and implant.&quot; 
                </p>
                <p>The 1985 definition (Br&aring;nemark text, Quintessence Publishing 
                  Co.) added that the implant must be load bearing: &quot;A direct structural 
                  and functional connection [must exist] between ordered living bone and 
                  the surface of a load-carrying implant.&quot;</p>
                <p>The 1986 definition in this article included the condition that osseointegration 
                  &quot;can only be judged after a substantial period of implant service.&quot; 
                  This is a &quot;Catch 22&quot; definition in view of the authors’ statement 
                  that &quot;the Br&aring;nemark results...clearly underscore the basic 
                  concept of osseointegration as being the major, if not the exclusive, 
                  reason for a successful long-term dental implant attachment.&quot;</p>
                <p>Newly Proposed Criteria for Implant Success</p>
                <p>The authors propose five criteria for implant success and maintain 
                  that, if their criteria are not met, then &quot;from both legal and 
                  humanitarian points of view, &quot;patients should be informed about 
                  the investigative character of such treatment.&quot; Neither the FDA 
                  nor the ADA subscribe to this criteria. The first two –– &quot;immobile 
                  when tested clinically&quot; and absence of &quot;peri-implant radiolucency&quot; 
                  –– are the same parameters used in the previously discussed Lubar and 
                  Katin Core-Vent study. These are the only clinical tests for osseointegration. 
                  Two of the remaining three criteria include &quot;absence of persistent...symptoms, 
                  such as pain&quot; and an annual rate of bone loss of less than 0.2mm 
                  after the first year. Patient comfort and a slow rate of bone loss would 
                  be inherent with an osseointegrated implant if osseointegration determines 
                  &quot;a successful long-term dental implant attachment&quot; as the 
                  authors claim.</p>
                <p>Their last criteria proposes &quot;a success rate of 85% at the end 
                  of a five-year observation period.&quot; An extensive report on the 
                  Swedish clinical results is given by the authors, concluding that &quot;recently 
                  published figures from the Br&aring;nemark group, and in centers outside 
                  Sweden, indicate that the implant’s five-year survival rate in the mandible 
                  may, in fact, be higher than 95%.&quot; No references were given to 
                  support this statement. In fact, they reported on the same articles 
                  reviewed by Robert James (Implantologist, Vol. 3, No. 3, 1986) in his 
                  article subtitled, &quot;Br&aring;nemark ‘Fixtures’ Fail to Meet Recommendations 
                  of Harvard Implant Consensus Conference.&quot; He concluded:</p>
                <p>&#9;The reports from Sweden...appear to be designed to provide artificially 
                  enhanced results which are not consistent, either internally or with 
                  the report by Zarb and Symington.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>References to the first two years of the University of Toronto Br&aring;nemark 
                  replication study reported by Zarb and Symington in 1983 in the Journal 
                  of Prosthetic Dentistry (Vol. 50, No. 2, 1983) and follow-up results 
                  used in the application for ADA provisional approval are conspicuous 
                  by their absence in this article. Through the legal process of discovery 
                  in the Core-Vent/Nobelpharma litigation, a report entitled, &quot;5 
                  Year Toronto Osseointegration Results,&quot; was produced. It is in 
                  the form of a letter dated July 30, 1985 from Dr. John F. Cox on University 
                  of Toronto letterhead, to Mr. Ulf Wahlstrom of Bofors Biotech, Gothenburg, 
                  Sweden (copies available from Core-Vent Corporation).</p>
                <p>The Cox letter appears to include all consecutively inserted implants 
                  done at the University of Toronto from October 30, 1979 through March 
                  1, 1984 and can, therefore, be used to substantiate the results reported 
                  in Zarb’s 1983 article, which infers that it is reporting on the first 
                  twelve patients treated at the University of Toronto:</p>
                <p>&#9;Forty-five patients were selected for treatment in this Toronto 
                  study, and 12 of these patients have worn their prostheses for over 
                  2 years. This report reviews our short-term observations on the 12 treated 
                  patients. </p>
                <p>Zarb’s 1983 article reported that these 12 patients had a total of 
                  69 implants inserted with 59 implants retained, supporting fixed bridges. 
                  This is a success rate of 85.5%, which he concluded &quot;certainly 
                  endorses the viability of our Swedish colleagues’ claims.&quot; This 
                  differs markedly from the results that Cox reports for the first consecutive 
                  12 cases treated at the University of Toronto. The Cox report documents 
                  the first 12 cases dating from October 30, 1979 through May 21, 1981 
                  with a total of 73 implants inserted and with 56 implant retained, supporting 
                  fixed bridges. This is a success rate of 76.7%. </p>
                <p>The Toronto Study used osseointegration as its criteria of success. 
                  To call an implant osseointegrated requires, according to the 1985 definition 
                  stated above, that it be &quot;load-carrying.&quot; Therefore, implants 
                  that were not restorable because of their angulation and were &quot;put 
                  to sleep,&quot; have been included in the unsuccessful count in my analysis 
                  of Dr. Cox’s report. Furthermore, the inability to deal with malpositioned 
                  implants because the heads cannot be bent, is a reflection of the system 
                  and therefore relates to its overall success.</p>
                <p>In view of the authors’ statement that &quot;any implant losses after 
                  the first one to two years of function seem to be unlikely, provided 
                  osseointegration has occurred,&quot; the difference in the success rate 
                  between the Zarb and Cox reports cannot be explained by the fact that 
                  the implant have been observed by Cox for two additional years (Zarb 
                  report was 1983, Cox report was 1985).</p>
                <p>The authors state that &quot;we would wish and emphasize the desirability, 
                  in any clinical trial of implants, of the fate of all consecutive implants 
                  being faithfully recorded. Lamentably, this has seldom been done.&quot; 
                  In light of the controversy over James’ conclusions of &quot;artificially 
                  enhanced results&quot; with the with the Swedish reports, the Zarb Replication 
                  Study becomes pivotal in validating the authors’ claim. It would appear 
                  from a review of the Cox report that, regardless of where the series 
                  would be started, no consecutive number of patients received the total 
                  of 69 implants reported by Zarb. Therefore, &quot;lamentably&quot; the 
                  Zarb et al. 1983 article does not add validity to his &quot;Swedish 
                  colleagues’ claims.&quot; </p>
                <p>The first 12 cases reported by Cox for the University of Toronto Br&aring;nemark 
                  Replication Study demonstrated an implant success rate of 76.7%, which 
                  is minimally above the ADA 75% requirement and fails by over 8% to meet 
                  the criteria for five-year success of 85% proposed by the authors (which 
                  includes Dr. George Zarb, Director of the Toronto study). The Cox report 
                  further showed that the success rate for implants inserted in the fourth 
                  year (80.7%) was less than for those inserted in the first year (83.3%). 
                  In the first four years, a total of 178 implants were inserted with 
                  147 retained for a success of 82.6%. The results improved with the last 
                  94 implants placed in the fifth and sixth years of the study, but had 
                  only a 1-2 year follow-up time as of the filing of the 1985 Cox report. 
                  This suggests a rather significant learning curve with the surgical 
                  protocol of the Br&aring;nemark System. The Cox report also documented 
                  bridge fractures which occurred in an astounding 60% of the cases placed 
                  in the first four years, and screw fractures of 9% in the same period.</p>
                <p>Of the 178 implants placed in the first four years of the Replication 
                  Study, 93% were placed in the symphysis of the edentulous mandible which 
                  is generally accepted to provide the most ideal opportunity for success 
                  because of the quality and quantity of bone in that area and the ease 
                  of access for implant insertion. The Swedish results in the maxillary 
                  edentulous jaws with the non tapping, solid screw design of the Br&aring;nemark 
                  Implant were reported in this article to be 10% less successful than 
                  in the mandible. This can be contrasted with a recent report on the 
                  clinical experiences with consecutively placed Core-Vent Implant by 
                  Drs. R. Lubar, R. Katin, A. Buchs, J. Zosky, and D. Patrick. Dr. Dan 
                  Laskin, Editor of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, presented 
                  their results of 609 implants at the 1986 AAOMS national meeting. Their 
                  initial experience ranging up to 4 years, demonstrated an overall success 
                  rate of 96.6%, as determined by the achievement and maintenance of osseointegration 
                  with no differences in the success rates reported for the mandible (362 
                  implants) or the maxilla (257 implants). This is possibly due to the 
                  self-tapping design of the Core-Vent Implant, which assures immediate 
                  fixation even in porous bone and the hollow-vented geometry that allows 
                  bone ingrowth. These results suggest that the Core-Vent Implant is more 
                  user-friendly than the Br&aring;nemark System, especially for use in 
                  the maxilla.</p>
                <p>5.&#9;STATEMENT: The concluding &quot;Author Comments&quot; misunderstand 
                  the raison d’etre of Core-Vent Corporation’s new screw fixture. Albrektsson 
                  and his colleagues refer to the introduction of the Screw-Vent implant 
                  as an &quot;overt attempt to copy the Br&aring;nemark screw implant,&quot; 
                  and falsely state that its introduction was the result of &quot;consequential 
                  design changes.&quot; Yes, the Screw-Vent was designed to replicate 
                  the Br&aring;nemark implant in material, size and thread configuration 
                  and can be inserted by using many of the same instruments. The Screw-Vent 
                  Implant was granted FDA marketing approval (510K #K861426/B) upon the 
                  demonstration by Core-Vent Corporation that it was &quot;substantially 
                  equivalent&quot; to the Biotes Implant which received its FDA 510K approval 
                  in 1984. What the authors failed to appreciate is that the Screw-Vent 
                  (3.75mm OD) is smaller in diameter than the smallest Core-Vent (4.3mm 
                  OD) and, along with our even smaller Micro-Vent Implant (3.25mm OD), 
                  furthers the Core-Vent concept of providing the profession with design 
                  and dimensional options to meet the anatomical limitations and functional 
                  requirements of the patient.</p>
                <p>If these authors are sincere in their plea that &quot;the clinical 
                  methods advocated by Br&aring;nemark...must be continuously challenged 
                  in order to define possible refinements,&quot; and if they truly acknowledge 
                  that the Br&aring;nemark System is &quot;criticized for being complicated 
                  and expensive,&quot; then they should welcome the Screw-Vent fixture. 
                  It has a far simpler surgical protocol, is more versatile in its prosthetic 
                  applications and is accessible and affordable to a wider segment of 
                  the dental profession and, ultimately, a larger number of patients. 
                  Instead, this admittedly biased article injects more confusion, uncertainty 
                  and polarization into an area of dentistry that offers hope for a better 
                  quality of life to millions of dental cripples.</p>
