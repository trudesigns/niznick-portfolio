                <p>Introduction</p>
                <p>Biomedical Business International, an independent research organization, 
                  recently published their 1988 analysis of the dental implant market. 
                  They reported that Core-Vent Corporation accounted for 49% of all osseo- 
                  integrated implants sold, but only a 33% share of the dollar sales of 
                  the market. According to the report, Nobelpharma Inc., distributors 
                  of the Br&aring;nemark System,&trade; accounted for 29% of the market 
                  share in numbers of implants sold but 38% in dollar sales. Nobelpharma 
                  has, in a recent publication, pointed to the 38% figure as evidence 
                  of their leadership in the implant industry. Core-Vent Corporation s 
                  proud of the fact that it is the &quot;cost containment leader&quot; 
                  of the dental implant industry. Core-Vent Corporation’s large customer 
                  base of approximately 5,000 systems sold worldwide has made it possible 
                  to provide a wide selection of implants, prosthetic abutments and instruments 
                  at reasonable prices. This has allowed a greater number of dentists 
                  the opportunity to offer their patients the benefits of aesthetic functional 
                  restorations supported by osseointegrated implants.</p>
                <p>The Core-Vent system has evolved over the last six years from one implant 
                  design and size accepting only cemented abutments to a variety of five 
                  cylindrical designs with equal emphasis on cemented and threaded abutments. 
                  The growth of the implant industry was paralleled by a growth by Core-Vent 
                  Corporation from four employees in 1984 to 110 by 1988. As the acceptance 
                  of implants by organized dentistry expanded, so did the standards by 
                  which implants were judged. Core-Vent Corporation is again in the forefront 
                  of setting these standards in precision fit, prosthetic versatility, 
                  surface cleanliness and state-of-the-art packaging.</p>
                <p>Clinical Predictability - Risk Perception</p>
                <p>Predictability in both achieving and maintaining osseointegration is 
                  a function of the skill and judgement of the surgeon, as well as the 
                  user-friendliness of the system. Being able to accomplish the desired 
                  prosthetic result is also of paramount importance in selecting an implant 
                  system. Risk perception has been an important factor in deciding which 
                  system to use. In this regard, two recent events bare consideration:</p>
                <p>• ADA Limits Nobelpharma’s Approval to Totally&nbsp;Edentulous Patients</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma was granted ADA Provisional Approval in 1985 based on its 
                  Swedish and University of Toronto Studies, the latter showing about 
                  85% implant success in totally edentulous jaws. With provisional approval 
                  set to expire in September 1988, the ADA granted the Br&aring;nemark 
                  Implant full approval but clarified that this approval of the Br&aring;nemark 
                  System does not include its use in partially edentulous patients at 
                  this time.</p>
                <p>Core-Vent’s pending application with the ADA is for approval in completely 
                  and partially edentulous jaws. Core-Vent Corporation has been informed 
                  that its application is in the final stages of review.</p>
                <p>• NIH/FDA Implant Consensus Conference</p>
                <p>On June 13-15, 1988 in Bethesda, MD, the National institutes of Health 
                  (NIH) in concert with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a 
                  Consensus Development Conference to formulate an Implant Consensus Statement. 
                  A panel of twelve researchers and clinicians was appointed to evaluate 
                  information from a number of presenters and formulate a consensus statement 
                  on dental implants.</p>
                <p>The position of the Br&aring;nemark system and its research was well 
                  represented by Drs. Br&aring;nemark and Zarb (co-authors of the textbook 
                  on the Br&aring;nemark System) and Drs. Worthington and Bolender (co-directors 
                  of the Seattle Br&aring;nemark Teaching Center). Dr. Paul Schnitman, 
                  head of the department of Implantology, Harvard University presented 
                  results on a number of implants including the Core-Vent System. The 
                  format of the conference allowed an opportunity for questions, short 
                  slide presentations and statements from members of the audience numbering 
                  over 1,000.</p>
                <p>Core-Vent/Br&aring;nemark Statistics Presented</p>
                <p>The Core-Vent clinical study (Drs. Patrick, Lubar, Zosky and Buchs 
                  - submitted for publication) was reported to the panel. It analyzed 
                  the success of 1,605 consecutively placed Core-Vent Implants with up 
                  to 5 years of follow-up. These Core-Vent Implants were placed in both 
                  totally and partially edentulous jaws and also included 95 free-standing 
                  implants. The overall results documented a 96.2% success rate with 628 
                  maxillary implants and 96.7% success rate with 977 mandibular implants. 
                  Over half of the implants had been in partially edentulous jaws. The 
                  results of Core-Vent Implants in partially edentulous jaws showed approximately 
                  a 98% success rate with no significant difference between upper and 
                  lower jaws. This was contrasted with results reported by Albrektsson 
                  (May 1988 Article, Journal of Periodontology) on the Br&aring;nemark 
                  Implant. The Albrektsson article documented maxillary implants with 
                  a 1-7 year follow-up showing 90% success and with a 5-7 year follow-up 
                  showing 85% success. When sleeper implants (0.8%) were included in the 
                  statistics along with failures, the Br&aring;nemark fixtures, by the 
                  5-7 year period, had about 15% greater failure rate in the edentulous 
                  upper jaws than fixture reported in edentulous lower jaws in this study.</p>
                <p>NIH Consensus Panel Statement</p>
                <p>The NIH Consensus panel, after reviewing written and oral presentations 
                  on the Br&aring;nemark System, Core-Vent System and others, concluded 
                  in their published statement that:</p>
                <p>&#9;There is evidence from a number of case series studies that a large 
                  proportion of specific types of dental implants remain in place for 
                  periods of 10 years or more when inserted by clinicians experienced 
                  with the respective techniques. However, it is difficult to make definitive 
                  statements on the long-term effectiveness of dental implants from these 
                  case series studies because of unreported information and the lack of 
                  uniform application of proper research designs. Although the ideal research 
                  techniques should be a randomized, controlled clinical trial, case series 
                  studies are capable of providing limited evidence when proper methods 
                  are used. </p>
                <p>Nowhere in the 15-page statement (available upon written request from 
                  Core-Vent Corporation) is there any reference to the Br&aring;nemark 
                  Implant research being more valid or its clinical results being superior 
                  to the research or clinical results reported for the Core-Vent Implant. 
                  All implant studies presented were collectively referred to as &quot;case 
                  series studies.&quot; The statement further confirmed that &quot;...technological 
                  advances in the construction and insertion of various implants, will 
                  likely result in a trend toward improved long-term success rates.&quot;</p>
                <p>The findings of the Consensus Development Panel heralded a new era 
                  in Implantology. They appeared to refute the claims by proponents of 
                  the Nobelpharma System that Br&aring;nemark research offers &quot;the 
                  only clinical implant study that has survived scientific scrutiny&quot; 
                  (Dr. Zarb, Nobelpharma brochure).</p>
                <p>From a comparison of the Patrick et al. study and the Albrektsson study, 
                  Core-Vent’s hollow vented, self-tapping screw design may offer advantages 
                  in the porous maxillary bone to a solid screw design inserted following 
                  use of a bone-tap instrument. Nobelpharma’s 1988 introduction of two 
                  self-tapping fixtures, one with a new conical neck (similar to the neck 
                  of the Screw-Vent Implant), appears to confirm that Nobelpharma now 
                  agrees with this. It also appears from the sale of this new implant 
                  that Nobelpharma may have abandoned its marketing position that implants 
                  should have 5-10 year multi-center clinical studies reported in refereed 
                  journals before being sold. One should inquire whether the new implants, 
                  which differ in design and surgical protocol form the clinical studies 
                  submitted to the ADA, have ADA approval even for use in fully edentulous 
                  jaws.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s Unsubstantiated Claims</p>
                <p>Over the last few years, Nobelpharma has become aggressive in its comparative 
                  advertising with claims of superiority in clinical results and quality 
                  manufacturing. Nobelpharma appears to have chosen this route rather 
                  than compete with Core-Vent Corporation on price or product versatility. 
                  Core-Vent Corporation believes that many of these claims are unsubstantiated:</p>
                <p>Claim 1: &quot;...only one (Nobelpharma) offers the complete system 
                  essential to long-term success of your practice.&quot; </p>
                <p>Fact 1: The Core-Vent System of Osseointegrated Implants offers five 
                  cylindrical designs in a variety of dimensions and provides abutment 
                  options that include a selection of cemented or threaded connections 
                  and bendable or castable abutments. The Core-Vent System was found to 
                  be the only &quot;complete system&quot; according to a recent report 
                  by Clinical Research Associates, an independent clinical research organization 
                  (available upon request from Core-Vent Corporation). Long-term success 
                  of anyone’s practice will not depend on any one system or procedure, 
                  but on the knowledge, skill and care given to patients.</p>
                <p>Claim 2: &quot;No other method guarantees its results, and no other 
                  procedure puts the healthy glow back into living.&quot;</p>
                <p>Fact 2: Nobelpharma does not guarantee its results.</p>
                <p>Claim 3: &quot;99% long-term and complication-free success for bridges 
                  anchored in the lower jaw.&quot;</p>
                <p>Fact 3: The textbook, Osseointegration in Clinical Dentistry, by Br&aring;nemark, 
                  Zarb and Albrektsson report that 3% of the cases experienced fractures 
                  in one or more fixtures. The University of Toronto Br&aring;nemark Replication 
                  Study showed that, in the first 4 years of the 30 bridges supported 
                  by Br&aring;nemark fixtures, 26.6% experienced one or more screw fractures 
                  and 60% reported fractures of the frameworks.</p>
                <p>Claim 4: &quot;Here is the only system that used the revolutionary 
                  method of osseointegration to attach a dental prosthesis permanently 
                  to the very jawbone itself.&quot;</p>
                <p>Fact 4: Primate studies by Lum and Beirne comparing Core-Vent to Br&aring;nemark 
                  implants placed side-by-side and loaded for up to one year (presented 
                  AADR meeting 1987, accepted for publication , JPD) showed that the Core-Vent 
                  Implant osseointegrated as well as the Br&aring;nemark Implant and both 
                  maintained osseointegration for up to one year of observation.</p>
                <p>Claim 5: 5-12 years’ results where &quot;the success rate of prosthesis 
                  registered 96% in the upper jaw.&quot;</p>
                <p>Fact 5: Adell (1983 article, JPD) reported 96% continuous function 
                  of upper jaw bridges with 1 4 year follow-up referred to as group 2B. 
                  He later reported (November 1987, Harvard meeting) that the results 
                  of this group, then with 6-10 year observation, dropped to under 91% 
                  bridge success.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma Attempts to Patent TiO<sub>2</sub></p>
                <p>In 1986, Nobelpharma sued Core-Vent Corporation for patent infringement. 
                  Core-Vent counter sued, alleging that Nobelpharma and Dr. Br&aring;nemark 
                  &quot;applied for a U.S. patent but failed to disclose either the prior 
                  art found by the Swedish Patent Office, Dr. Br&aring;nemark’s own 1977 
                  publication, or Dr. Br&aring;nemark’s 1972 UK patent.&quot;</p>
                <p>1972 –– Dr. Br&aring;nemark (through a Swedish company) receives a 
                  UK patent #1291470 for his titanium implant. The patent was never issued 
                  in Sweden or the United States. This patent states: &quot;The best material 
                  hitherto known, however, certainly is pure or weakly alloyed titanium.&quot;</p>
                <p>1977 –– Dr. Br&aring;nemark published a book on his experience with 
                  titanium implants. The review of the literature referred to a 1972 article 
                  by Morse that had reported irregularities from machining and pitted 
                  areas from formation of titanium oxide corrosion products on titanium 
                  implants:</p>
                <p>&#9;The new and used implants exhibited surface striation and irregularities 
                  which had apparently resulted from the tooling process, and some dark 
                  pitted areas representing surface corrosion, primarily from titanium. 
                  The main corrosion product was titanium oxide, believed to be relatively 
                  inert.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>1979 –– Dr. Br&aring;nemark and an employee of Bofors, the Swedish 
                  conglomerate that later formed the Nobelpharma Corporation, filed a 
                  Swedish and American patent on a micro-pitted, titanium dioxide surface 
                  on titanium implants. The United States patent was issued in 1982 and 
                  is the subject of the current litigation. Included among the patent 
                  claims is the following:</p>
                <p>Claim #3: &quot;An element according to claim 1, wherein said material 
                  is titanium having a decreasing oxygen content from a titanium dioxide 
                  micro-pitted surface inwardly.&quot;</p>
                <p>THE 1972 BRITISH PATENT AND THE 1977 ARTICLE WERE NOT REVEALED TO THE 
                  UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE AS IS REQUIRED OF ALL MATERIAL 
                  PRIOR ART. </p>
                <p>1986 –– Dr. Br&aring;nemark and an employee of Nobelpharma filed European 
                  Patent Application #86850348.3 claiming:</p>
                <p>Claim #1: &quot;A material of unalloyed titanium for implantation in 
                  body tissue, characterized in that the surface of inorganic atomic layer 
                  of the material contains: Ti 29-33, O 61-67 expressed in atomic percent.&quot; 
                </p>
                <p>This European patent application appears to claim to have discovered 
                  a surface of titanium that is approximately 1 part titanium and 2 parts 
                  oxygen –– i.e. TiO2. The Nobelpharma/Br&aring;nemark 1982 United States 
                  patent had already disclosed the following:</p>
                <p>&#9;When stored, titanium (and even low-alloyed titanium after machining) 
                  quickly acquires an oxidized surface equivalent to a crystallized surface 
                  of rutile TiO2..</p>
                <p>THE SWEDE-VENT SYSTEM: American Price, Prosthetics and Practicality</p>
                <p>In this environment of marketing rhetoric and professional polarization, 
                  Core-Vent Corporation decided to introduce the Swede-Vent fixture, a 
                  &quot;Nobelpharma look-alike.&quot; This is not to be construed as an 
                  endorsement of the Br&aring;nemark design, but provides American competition 
                  to another inexpensive foreign product. The Swede-Vent fixture, made 
                  from commercially pure titanium, is being sold at the same price as 
                  Core-Vent, Screw-Vent and Micro-Vent implants. The wider neck of the 
                  Swede-Vent and Br&aring;nemark fixtures requires countersinking the 
                  crest of the ridge during the surgical procedure. This step initially 
                  removes several millimeters of valuable supporting bone. The wider neck 
                  concentrates the stress at the crest of the ridge during loading, resulting 
                  in a reported 1+ mm of additional bone loss in the first year of function, 
                  according to the Br&aring;nemark clinical studies.</p>
                <p>The Br&aring;nemark System was developed over 20 years ago and has 
                  undergone little change. One only has to look at changes in the computer 
                  industry in the last five years to see how modern technology and manufacturing 
                  has resulted in better, more cost-effective products.</p>
                <p>In 1986, Core-Vent Corporation introduced the Screw-Vent Implant</p>
                <p>The Screw-Vent Implant is a solid screw design made from commercially 
                  pure titanium matching the dimensions and pitch of threads of the original 
                  Br&aring;nemark fixture. Nobelpharma, in their 1988 Catalog, has now 
                  introduced a new fixture which also has a conical neck and is self-tapping. 
                  It sells for twice the cost of the Screw-Vent fixture, $230 vs. $115 
                  (price includes cover screw or surgical insert). Compared to the original 
                  3.75mm diameter Br&aring;nemark fixture (single-unit price, March 1988). 
                  Core-Vent Corporation charges the same $115 for its 3.75mm and 4.0mm 
                  diameter Swede-Vent fixtures and for its conical, self-tapping Screw-Vent 
                  fixture, because there is no significant differences in manufacturing 
                  costs. The Swede-Vent and Screw-Vent fixtures are acid etched to provide 
                  a metallurgically clean surface and they offer the following advantages:</p>
                <p>SCREW-VENT DESIGN ADVANTAGES compared to Swede-Vent and Nobelpharma</p>
                <p>1.&#9;Conical Neck with Internal Hex –– this will mean: </p>
                <p>&#9;a. No countersinking of crestal bone required.</p>
                <p>&#9;b. No exposed threads with bone loss up to 2.5mm.</p>
                <p>&#9;c. No reflection of periosteum needed to expose implant for connection 
                  of abutments –– less invasive &amp; less time consuming.</p>
                <p>&#9;d. Accepts both screw-in abutments (6 options) and castable cemented 
                  abutments that can overcome undesirable angled implant placement.</p>
                <p>&#9;e. Matching internal bevel of internally threaded implant and bevel 
                  of abutment for greater lateral support and stability.</p>
                <p>2.&#9;Threads all the way to the end –– this will mean: </p>
                <p>&#9;a. Elimination of bone tap procedure in all but the most dense 
                  bone for immediate congruency with vital bone.</p>
                <p>&#9;b. Increases initial stability of fixture with self-threading and 
                  apical threads engaging cortical bone under the nose and at the inferior 
                  border of the symphysis.</p>
                <p>SWEDE-VENT SURGICAL ADVANTAGES compared to Nobelpharma System:</p>
                <p>1.&#9;The Swede-Vent instruments are stainless steel coated with titanium 
                  nitride for increased hardness and lubricity for long-lasting cutting 
                  efficiency. This provides further cost savings over Nobelpharma’s disposable 
                  drills, which are not autoclavable and are to be discarded after each 
                  surgery (even if only a single implant site was prepared).</p>
                <p>2..&#9;The Swede-Vent instruments are internally irrigated for more 
                  efficient cooling, therefore eliminating one of the cutting steps for 
                  further economy of time and money.</p>
                <p>3.&#9;The Swede-Vent fixtures are provided suspended on a handle inside 
                  a double-vial sterile package for easy delivery to the surgical site. 
                  The Nobelpharma fixtures are provided in a titanium casing inside a 
                  glass ampule requiring breaking of the glass. Before the Nobelpharma 
                  fixture can be carried to the surgical site, additional steps and instruments 
                  are needed: </p>
                <p>Nobelpharma Insertion Procedures</p>
                <p>1. Pick up the titanium tube containing the fixture and transport it 
                  to a titanium holding tray.</p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;</p>
                <p>2. Attach a fixture mount device to the top of the Nobelpharma fixture.</p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;</p>
                <p>3. Carry the assembly of fixture and fixture mount to the surgical 
                  site with a contra-angle mandrel.</p>
                <p>4. Screw the fixture into place with slow-speed motor and complete 
                  with ratchet.</p>
                <p>5. Unscrew the fixture mount device.</p>
                <p>Swede-Vent Insertion Procedures</p>
                <p>1. Carry the fixture to the surgical site on the plastic handle used 
                  to suspend the implant in the inner vial. </p>
                <p>2. Remove the stopper and screw the fixture into place using the hex 
                  drill turning at 15 rpm. Finalize the seating with ratchet and hex tool. 
                  Both hex instruments interlock with the external hex on the implant 
                  and are, therefore, easily disengaged. </p>
                <p>SWEDE-VENT PROSTHETIC ADVANTAGES compared to Nobelpharma System</p>
                <p>The Swede-Vent System offers 5 abutment options with one of the designs 
                  (straight walled, 1 piece abutment in 3 lengths) accepting 4 different 
                  screws for overdenture applications (ball and magnet attachments, rigid 
                  and resilient bar attachments). The titanium and plastic castable Crown 
                  &amp; Bridge abutments for the Swede-Vent bring conventional restorative 
                  procedures to the Br&aring;nemark fixture design. Surgical specialists 
                  are able to accept referrals from general dentists and prosthodontists 
                  without requiring that they take expensive Nobelpharma sponsored training 
                  programs. All the Swede-Vent prosthetic abutments are compatible with 
                  Nobelpharma fixtures and provide up to 70% savings (abutment and laboratory 
                  components needed per fixture) compared to Nobelpharma’s single-unit 
                  prices. The cost savings will add to your net income and allow more 
                  patients to take advantage of your skills and training.</p>
                <p>IMPLANTOLOGY –– PAST AND PRESENT</p>
                <p>Since the Core-Vent and Br&aring;nemark Systems of Osseointegrated 
                  Implants were first introduced to the North American continent in 1982, 
                  dentistry has experienced an implant revolution. The Core Vent System 
                  has undergone rapid evolution in the past six years. Core-Vent Corporation 
                  has received patents on the Core-Vent Implant and has patents pending 
                  on the SUB-Vent&reg;, Micro Vent&reg; and Bio-Vent&trade; Implants, 
                  and on its innovative Hex-Thread&trade; connection that accepts both 
                  cemented cast posts and a variety of screw-in abutments. In addition, 
                  patents on prosthetic abutments have been awarded for the flush-fitting, 
                  castable head, the bendable heads and the Core Vent Attachment. Core-Vent 
                  Corporation funded the development of Ion Sputter Application of Hydroxylapatite 
                  to provide a thinner, denser coating on titanium implants. This coating 
                  is now available on the Micro-Vent&reg; Implants offering both mechanical 
                  retention and the firmly adherent HA coating in a tap-in/screw-in design. 
                  Core-Vent Corporation has been able to provide these advances to the 
                  dental profession while maintaining its leadership in cost containment 
                  because of a large customer base.</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation’s variety of implant systems provides design 
                  and dimensional options to overcome limitations in quality and quantity 
                  of bone. The Core-Vent&reg;, Screw-Vent&reg;, Micro Vent&reg;, SUB-Vent&reg; 
                  (submergible blade) and Swede-Vent Systems provide the dentist with 
                  a choice of materials, design and surgical procedures to meet his/her 
                  individual training, experience and personal preferences. For those 
                  dentists who prefer a non-threaded, cylindrical design, such as the 
                  IMZ (Interpore Inc.) or Integral Implant (Calcitek Inc.), but would 
                  like the advantages of the Core-Vent System’s price and prosthetics, 
                  Core-Vent Corporation has developed the Bio-Vent&trade; Implant. This 
                  is a plasma-sprayed, HA-coated cylinder with vertical, anti-rotation 
                  grooves and an apical vent(pat. pend.) to allow escape of trapped blood 
                  for full seating. Expected delivery date is December 1988. </p>
                <p>THE TRUE SYSTEM&trade; OF OSSEOINTEGRATED IMPLANTS </p>
                <p>The surgical goal of the dentist should be to fit the implant to the 
                  patient, rather than fit the patient to the particular design or size 
                  of the implant. With this principle in mind, Core-Vent Corporation has 
                  developed a &quot;System of Systems.&quot; In selecting an implant system, 
                  it is also important to consider the strength of the company and whether 
                  it will be here to service your needs in the future. Core-Vent Corporation 
                  has grown from 4 employees in 1984 to 110 in 1988 with offices in 4 
                  countries and distributors in 15 additional countries. Core-Vent Corporation 
                  has sold approximately 5,000 systems worldwide.</p>
                <p>IMPLANTOLOGY –– THE FUTURE</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation will continue to be successful in this competitive 
                  market by providing the profession with what it needs: simplified surgical 
                  procedures, versatile prosthetic applications, accessible educational 
                  programs, technical and marketing support and prices that have allowed 
                  implantology to take its rightful place in the mainstream of conventional 
                  dentistry. </p>
