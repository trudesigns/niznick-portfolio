                </font>
                </b> <font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
                <p>Throughout the first fifteen years of Br&aring;nemarks research publications 
                  (1969-1984), only one definition of osseointegration was used. This 
                  definition was succinctly stated in his 1984 article.</p>
                <p>1984 DEFINITION - Br&aring;nemark et al., JOMS, Vol. 42, No. 8, 1984: 
                  "Osseointegration means a direct contact, on the light-microscopic level, 
                  between living bone tissue and the implant."</p>
                <p>1985 DEFINITION - Br&aring;nemark, Albrektsson, Zarb, Tissue Integrated 
                  Prostheses, Quintessence Publishing Company: "A direct structural and 
                  functional connection (must exist) between ordered living bone and the 
                  surface of a load-carrying implant."</p>
                <p>CHANGE: Added that the implant must be in function</p>
                <p>1986 DEFINITION - Albrektsson, Zarb et al., JOMI, Vol. 1, No. 1, 1986: 
                  "Oseointegration is a histological definition and only partially a clinical 
                  and radiographic one. An implant can only be judged as osseointegrated 
                  in the context of a continuum of observation...Hence the proposal that 
                  both clinical evidence of mobility and radiographic bone response be 
                  judged after a substantial period of implant service."</p>
                <p>CHANGE: Added that the implant could only be considered osseointegrated 
                  if it had been osseointegrated for &quot;a substantial period of implant 
                  service&quot; (Catch 22 definition).</p>
                <p>CONTRADICTION: The same article stated that &quot;Br&aring;nemark results...clearly 
                  underscore the basic concept of osseointegration as being the major, 
                  if not the exclusive, reason for a successful long-term dental implant 
                  attachment.&quot;</p>
                <p>The same article further stated by way of reference to &quot; Br&aring;nemark, 
                  P-I, Personal Communication, 1986: these results indicate that any 
                  implant losses after the first one to two years of function seem to 
                  be unlikely, provided osseointegration has occurred.&quot;</p>
                <p>1987 DEFINITION - Albrektsson et al., JPD, May 1987: "A properly osseointegrated 
                  implant at the cortical passage should have a minimal direct bone contact 
                  of 90 percent of the implant surface. This high degree of osseointegration 
                  should completely surround the circumference of the cylindrical implant."</p>
                <p>CONTRADICTION: An abstract by Helm et al. presented at 1987 International 
                  Preprosthetic Surgery Symposium concluded that the Br&aring;nemark Implant 
                  &quot;had less than a quarter of the endosseous area in direct contact 
                  with bone.&quot;</p>
                <p>1988 DEFINITION - Zarb et al., University of Toronto Dental Journal, 
                  Vol. 1, No. 2: "Osseointegration is a clinical application of a biologically 
                  investigated host bone to the placement of threaded, unalloyed titanium 
                  implants using a meticulous surgical procedure."</p>
                <p>CHANGE: Implies that implant design (&quot;threaded) and material (&quot;unalloyed 
                  titanium) are significant restrictions in extrapolating the predictability 
                  of osseointegration to other designs and materials that have demonstrated 
                  osseointegration. </p>
                <p>CONTRADICTION: Br&aring;nemark stated in his 1977 article (referenced 
                  above) that the &quot;...design of the implant...is of secondary importance 
                  to the mechanism of anchorage in the jaw bone...The careful handling 
                  of tissue and the use of an inert non-contaminated material are the 
                  prime prerequisites for osseointegration.&quot;</p>

                  will be based upon truth and scientific data, not on marketing hype."</p>
                <p>UNTRUE STATEMENT - Nobelpharmas 1988 booklet entitled, &quot;The Smile 
                  that Says Everything  Br&aring;nemark System&quot;: "Here is the only 
                  system that uses the revolutionary method of osseointegration to attach

                <p>Nobelpharma introduced two new self-tapping implant designs and a new

                  of the implants (conical design) looks like the self-tapping Screw-Vent

                <p>1988 NOBELPHARMAS POSITION ON LONG-TERM PREDICTABILITY OF OSSEOINTEGRATION</p>
                <p>Undated letter (received May 1987) to profession from the Product Manager 
                  of Nobelpharma USA:</p>
                <p>#3. CLAIM - &quot;Even though a fixture osseointegrates with the bone, 
                  it does not mean it can withstand the load of 5, 10, or even 20 years 
                  and more of normal function like the Br&aring;nemark System.&quot;</p>
                <p>FACT - Article by Albrektsson, Zarb et al. stated that the &quot;Br&aring;nemark 
                  results...clearly underscore the basic concept of osseointegration as 
                  being the major, if not the exclusive, reason for a successful long-term 
                  dental implant attachment.&quot;</p>
                <p>FACT - Nobelpharma advertisements continually claim 96% Upper Jaw Bridge 
                  success. When and if they reference this claim, it is to group 2B (1-4 
                  year follow-up) documented in Adells articles (Int. J. Oral Surg., 
                  1981; JPD, August, 1983). The same articles showed 5-12 year Upper Jaw 
                  Bridge success to be under 90%. Adell, in a presentation at Harvard 
                  School of Dental Medicine, November 1987, reported on the success of 
                  Upper Jaw Bridges in group 2, now with 6-10 year follow-up. The success 
                  rate has dropped to under 91%. </p>

                <p>Br&aring;nemark has proposed that the Biotes dental implant predictably 
                  replaces teeth by forming a direct connection with bone (osseointegration). 
                  Several implants, including Core-Vent Implants, adhere to the requirement 
                  to achieve osseointegration, but few studies have directly compared 
                  Core-Vent with the Biotes placed in non-human primates.</p>
                <p>The left and right 1st and 2nd mandibular molars were removed from 
                  5 Macca Mulatta monkeys. After 15 weeks of healing, 2 Biotes and 2 Core-Vent 
                  implants were placed, one each on the right and left mandible where 
                  the teeth had been removed. After 18 weeks, 1 animal was killed and 
                  crowns were placed on each implant in the remaining 4 animals. Two animals 
                  were killed 5 months and 2 were killed 12 months after placing the crowns.</p>
                <p>Clinical examination revealed that all implants were present without 
                  infection or mobility. Block sections containing the implants were removed, 
                  fixed in acetone and embedded in plastic. The blocks were sectioned 
                  through the long axis of the implants. Light microscopic examination 
                  revealed that both the Biotes and Core-Vent implants osseointegrated. 
                  Evaluation 5 and 12 months after placing the crown showed that the bone 
                  response to the two types of implants was the same and the implants 
                  maintained osseointegration.</p>
