                <p>1989 </p>
                <p>Response To Nobelpharma Letter: Postsettlement Disclaimer #1</p>
                <p>OPEN LETTER TO THE DENTAL PROFESSION</p>
                <p>On January 4, 1989, Core-Vent (Core-Vent Corporation) and Nobelpharma 
                  (Nobelpharma AB, a Swedish Company and Nobelpharma USA) entered into 
                  a settlement agreement resolving their legal disputes. A &quot;Joint 
                  Announcement of Settlement&quot; statement was agreed upon by both parties 
                  to be used to inform the profession of the &quot;amicable end to the 
                  controversy between them.&quot; On January 15, 1989, Nobelpharma conducted 
                  a wide mailing of this document and also included in the mailing a letter 
                  which misstates critical facts of the settlement and certain scientific 
                  issues related to the litigation. Core-Vent Corporation must now respond 
                  to Nobelpharma’s misleading letter to mitigate the damage its misinformation 
                  may cause.</p>
                <p>No amount of explanation or rationalization on Nobelpharma’s part can 
                  alter the fact that, as a result of the settlement agreement, Core-Vent 
                  Corporation is now licensed under all Br&aring;nemark and Nobelpharma 
                  patents and patent applications worldwide that cover Core-Vent Corporation’s 
                  implants, including, but not limited to, the single U.S. Patent No. 
                  4,330,891 that Nobelpharma referred to in its January 15th letter.</p>
                <p>History of Litigation</p>
                <p>In 1986, Nobelpharma, a subsidiary of Nobel Industries, a multi-billion 
                  dollar defence contractor, sued Core-Vent for alleged patent infringement 
                  and alleged false advertising, unfair competition and alleged attempts 
                  to monopolize the implant market. After three years of expensive maneuvering 
                  by the lawyers, the case settled the day the trial was to begin.</p>
                <p>Objective of the Litigation</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter states:</p>
                <p>&#9;We believe that our objectives in bringing suit against Core-Vent 
                  have been achieved. Core-Vent has agreed to the validity of our patent 
                  and no longer publishes certain advertising claims which we complained 
                  about. </p>
                <p>Patents</p>
                <p>Core-Vent’s agreement to the validity of one of the Br&aring;nemark 
                  patents Nobelpharma is licensed under was not Nobelpharma’s main objective 
                  in bringing suit. If it had been, the litigation would have been settled 
                  long ago. Past and present executives of Nobelpharma stated that its 
                  objective was to eliminate Core-Vent as an effective competitor in the 
                  implant market. Nobelpharma’s failure to achieve this objective has 
                  strengthened Core-Vent’s marketing position by sharing with Core-Vent 
                  worldwide patent rights under many of Dr. Br&aring;nemark’s patents 
                  and patent applications. </p>
                <p>Advertising</p>
                <p>The advertising Nobelpharma complained about was factual, appeared 
                  on or before 1986 and is no longer published because it became outdated 
                  for marketing purposes. Core-Vent’s counter suit contended that Nobelpharma’s 
                  advertisements were exaggerated and therefore misleading. Since the 
                  litigation started, both companies have made changes in their advertising, 
                  but not as a result of the settlement agreement.</p>
                <p>The Profession is the Real Winner</p>
                <p>The real winner is you, the dental professional, who now has a choice 
                  of two companies selling commercially pure titanium implants with a 
                  micro-pitted surface which, as Professor Br&aring;nemark states in his 
                  patent, &quot;provides the bio-optimal result.&quot; The patented micro-pitted 
                  surface and the reduced risk perception some professionals associate 
                  with Br&aring;nemark’s research that led to the discovery of the patented 
                  micro-structure, are now available from Core-Vent Corporation. The Swede-Vent 
                  Implant from Core-Vent, because of its design and dimensions, can be 
                  inserted using Nobelpharma’s surgical instruments of Core-Vent’s internally 
                  irrigated drills. The Screw-Vent Implant from Core-Vent matches the 
                  thread design and dimensions of the Br&aring;nemark fixture, but is 
                  provided with a neck that is no wider than the threads, eliminating 
                  the need for countersinking the crest of the bone. It is also designed 
                  to be self-tapping with threads all the way to the apex. Both Swede-Vent 
                  and Screw-Vent Implants are machined and then acid etched to provide 
                  a metallurgically clean, micro-pitted surface. Core-Vent Corporation 
                  manufactures its implants and prosthetic abutments to the highest standards 
                  of quality and precision in the industry. Because of the settlement, 
                  Core-Vent Corporation has been able to keep the same low prices for 
                  its implants, instruments and prosthetic abutments in 1989 as it had 
                  in 1988. Core-Vent provides its products to the profession at up to 
                  a 50% cost savings per implant (single unit price) and a 61%-71% cost 
                  savings per abutment compared to Nobelpharma’s prices –– WHY OVERPAY? 
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Significance of Br&aring;nemark’s Patented Micro-Pitted Surface</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter wrongly states that &quot;the patented 
                  invention involves only a particular type of micro-pitted surface on 
                  certain implants.&quot; That statement relates only to one part of one 
                  of the many patents and patent applications, worldwide, now licensed 
                  to Core-Vent Corporation.</p>
                <p>Fact:</p>
                <p>The &quot;type of micro-pitted surface&quot; covered by the &quot;patented 
                  invention&quot; was a result of Br&aring;nemark’s clinical studies. 
                  The Br&aring;nemark patent states that:</p>
                <p>&#9;An analysis of jaw implants in homo has unexpectedly shown that 
                  the operation results obtained are noticeably improved if the size of 
                  the micro-pitting approaches the order of magnitude of the cell diameter 
                  in the surrounding tissue or of a few multiples thereof. The normal 
                  cell size applicable is the order of 1000 nm.</p>
                <p>The Br&aring;nemark patent further states that:</p>
                <p>&#9;The bio-optimal result is achieved, however, if the pit diameter 
                  is selected in the range of 10 to 300 nm.</p>
                <p>An independent court expert was appointed to examine Nobelpharma and 
                  Core-Vent Corporation implants using computer-enhanced SEM analysis. 
                  He employed a sophisticated computer program to count the pits and reported 
                  his findings. His report confirmed that the surface treatment each company 
                  was applying to their implants resulted in substantially the same number 
                  of micro-pits in the range of 10 nm to 300 nm.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15, 1989, letter states:</p>
                <p>&#9;P.I. Br&aring;nemark’s years of experimentation and development 
                  led to adoption of a standardized implant design and material.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Fact:</p>
                <p>&quot;P.I. Br&aring;nemark’s years of experimentation and development&quot; 
                  also led to filing in 1979 of his application for U.S. Patent No. 4,330,891, 
                  the claims of which cover a micro-pitted titanium implant with a threaded 
                  surface and an apical vent. The Swede-Vent Implant from Core-Vent Corporation 
                  matches the &quot;standardized&quot; Br&aring;nemark implant in design, 
                  material and dimensions and now provides the patented micro-pitted surface 
                  that Br&aring;nemark’s Patent No. 4,330,891 states will give &quot;inextricable 
                  anchoring in the living bone tissue.&quot;</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter states:</p>
                <p>&#9;Core-Vent surfaces are acid etched in contrast to Br&aring;nemark 
                  fixtures which have a machined surface approved by Professor Br&aring;nemark.</p>
                <p>Fact:</p>
                <p>Core-Vent Corporation’s implants are first machined and then carefully 
                  acid etched to remove contaminants. Core-Vent started to acid etch its 
                  implants in 1986 because it is the best, if not the only way, to remove 
                  inorganic contamination from machined surfaces. Core-Vent’s proprietary 
                  formula of acid concentrations, the specific time the implant is exposed 
                  to the acid and the type of neutralizing solutions used to wash the 
                  etched implants produce the super-clean, micro pitted surface that, 
                  according to Br&aring;nemark’s patent, produces &quot;the bio-optimal 
                  result.&quot; </p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter refers to &quot;the formula for the 
                  Br&aring;nemark System&quot;: </p>
                <p>Among the patents both Nobelpharma and Core-Vent are now licensed under 
                  is U.S. Patent No. 4,330,891, issued to Br&aring;nemark et al. in 1982, 
                  which spells out the formula for the Br&aring;nemark Implant:</p>
                <p>1.&#9;Material:&#9;Bio-compatible</p>
                <p>&#9;Special materials such as titanium, titanium alloys, ceramic material 
                  or metal covered with ceramic material have been found to give acceptable 
                  biological integration.</p>
                <p>2.&#9;Design:&#9;Screw design with vents</p>
                <p>&#9;Over many years of experimental work, firm joints have been achieved 
                  with materials prepared in various manners, the surfaces of the connecting 
                  device being shaped with increased surface contact by means of corrugations 
                  and threading thereof.</p>
                <p>&#9;It has also been found advantageous to provide the implant with 
                  large through openings for bone tissue to grow through.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>3.&#9;Surface:&#9;Clean and micro-pitted</p>
                <p>&#9;Accordingly, the present invention provides an element intended 
                  for implantation in the body tissue consisting of a biologically flawless 
                  material with a porous, i.e., micro-pitted surface intended to face 
                  the tissue. </p>
                <p>4.&#9;Production:&#9;Machining most economic; Machining followed by 
                  acid etching also covered by patent</p>
                <p>&#9;Of course, the surface may be produced in some other manner, such 
                  as by sintering or metal vaporization in inert gas. However, the most 
                  economic method appears to be preparation with a cutting tool.</p>
                <p>5.&#9;Surgical Procedures:&#9;#9; Low speed bone preparation</p>
                <p>&#9;Experience has shown that careful threading of drilling holes in 
                  the bone tissue and of the corresponding implant using cutting tools 
                  of titanium working at low speed gives the best seal. </p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter states: </p>
                <p>&#9;...the settlement protects our proprietary interests in implant 
                  technologies.</p>
                <p>Fact:</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s lawsuit did not claim that Core-Vent misappropriated 
                  any trade secrets or other &quot;proprietary interests in implant technologies,&quot; 
                  so there were no &quot;proprietary interests&quot; the settlement protected. 
                  Professor Br&aring;nemark’s patents, published articles and books enable 
                  one to make the implant he patented.</p>
                <p>Conclusion:</p>
                <p>As a result of the lawsuit and counter suit, Nobelpharma and Professor 
                  Br&aring;nemark have granted Core-Vent Corporation a license under all 
                  presently issued patents and pending patent applications worldwide owned 
                  by Nobelpharma or Br&aring;nemark that cover Core-Vent Corporation’s 
                  implants. This includes U.S. patent No. 4,330,891, the same patent listed 
                  in Nobelpharma’s product catalog and journal advertisements.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma’s January 15th letter states that the decision to license 
                  Core-Vent &quot;does not in anyway represent an endorsement of Core-Vent’s 
                  products.&quot; Core-Vent Corporation neither wants nor needs Nobelpharma’s 
                  endorsement. The only endorsement Core-Vent believes is important is 
                  from the world dental community, and we will now be able to dedicate 
                  our resources to further achieve this objective. Core-Vent Corporation 
                  is proud to provide the profession with a wide variety of implants and 
                  prosthetic abutments, manufactured to the highest standards in the industry 
                  at prices that are affordable to both dentist and patient alike.</p>
