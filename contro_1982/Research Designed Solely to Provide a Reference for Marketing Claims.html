            <p align="CENTER">LETTER TO THE EDITOR</p>
            <p align="CENTER">International Journal of Prosthodontics, Volume 10, 
              Number 1, 1997</p>
            <p>Dear Editor:</p>
            <p>&#9;While Binon's article claims that Calcitek's Spline&reg; implant 
              interface is "stronger in compression by a factor of 3 to 5 times over 
              internal and external hexagon and internal octagon interfaces,"this 
              claim is clearly not supported by the data reported in this article. 
              Although the Spline implant is produced in diameters of 4.0mm and 3.3mm, 
              Binon generated test data for his article only on the larger diameter 
              implant. In reaching his conclusion as to strength superiority, Binon 
              compared his 4.0mm diameter Spline test results with external results 
              reported in the literature for the "internal and external hexagon and 
              internal octagon interfaces," rather than testing these implants himself 
              under the same controlled conditions. </p>
            <p>&#9;The unreliability of this method of comparison is apparent just 
              from a review of Table 2 of Binon's article, which cites two studies 
              reporting torsion failure for Calcitek's internal octagon implant of 
              37.3 Ncm in one study and 101.5 Ncm in another study. This represents 
              a 300% difference, clearly indicating that variations can occur in test 
              methods or equipment used in different studies. For this reason, comparisons 
              of this type are inherently unreliable. </p>
            <p>&#9;Table 2 of the Binon study also compares torsional failure of 192.1 
              Ncm for Dentsply's internal hex Screw-Vent&reg; implant (as reported 
              by other investigators), which has a 3.5mm diameter neck, to 219.3 Ncm 
              for the 4.0mm diameter neck of the Spline implant. The difference between 
              the diameters of the necks of these two implants is 14%, which alone 
              could account for the 14% difference in torsional strength noted by 
              Binon. If Binon had reversed the diameter relationship and compared 
              the 4.0mm diameter Spline implant with the larger diameter Screw-Vent 
              with a 4.5mm diameter neck, his conclusions would almost certainly have 
              been dramatically altered. </p>
            <p>&#9;Binon could have conducted a more valid and accurate comparison 
              study by conducting torsion and compression loading-to-failure tests 
              under the same controlled conditions with the 3.3mm diameter Spline 
              implant and the 3.3mm diameter Screw Vent implant. By only testing the 
              4.0mm diameter Spline implant, and then comparing his results with other 
              studies done using different diameter implants and different test procedures, 
              it appears that he is "seeking to prove a point rather than to investigate 
              a theory," as your editorial warns against.</p>
            <p>&#9;Variations in test procedures and equipment are even more critical 
              with "Thirty Degree Compressive Load to Failure" tests of the type reported 
              in Table 3 of Binon's article. Such variables as the exact location 
              where the implant is gripped on its neck, the length of the abutment 
              and where the force is applied along the length of the abutment, will 
              all determine the moment-arm and, thus, the amount of force that effectively 
              creates failure of the implant/abutment connection. </p>
            <p>&#9;Since Binon draws his conclusions from different reported tests 
              conducted without these controls, his comparisons and conclusions are 
              invalid. The range of the results for 30-degree compressive load-to-failure 
              tests, cited in Table 3 for the Balfour and O'Brien study [J Prosthet 
              Dent 1995;73:36-43] of 587Ncm, 756Ncm and 814Ncm for the Omniloc&reg;, 
              Nobelpharma and Screw-Vent implants, respectively, are the type of range 
              that one would anticipate for these three implants, given their differences 
              in implant material and implant/abutment interface surfaces. These magnitudes 
              are substantially different from the 3470Ncm reported by Binon for the 
              Spline implant, and should indicate that Binon's testing procedures 
              created a moment-arm that was significantly reduced from that created 
              in the controlled comparative study conducted by Balfour and O'Brien. 
              It is unresolved issues of this type that render the Binon article unreliable, 
              and most likely misleading. </p>
            <p>&#9;It is interesting to note that, while Binon reports in Table 4 
              the "Rotational Abutment Movement Tolerance (degrees of rotation) for 
              the Spline as 0.12 degrees (using the protractor method) with the abutment 
              seated using 30Ncm of torque (p. 422), he reports 0.4 degrees of rotation 
              for the Screw-Vent internal hex (p. 431), citing his earlier article 
              in Postgraduate Dentistry; "The Evolution and Evaluation of Two Interference-Fit 
              Implant Interfaces," 1996;2:1-15 (the "PGD Article").</p>
            <p> A review of the PGD Article (p.6), however, reveals that this 0.4 
              degree rotation for the internal hex was only recorded for those abutments 
              tightened with finger pressure, whereas the same article reports 0 rotation 
              when the abutment was tightened to the recommended 30Ncm, the same as 
              that used by Binon for the Spline implant. Even more interestingly, 
              in Table 4 Binon also reports 1.4 degrees of rotation for the internal 
              hex implant/abutment interface, based upon another study he performed 
              [Int J Prosthodont 1995;8:162-178], but neglects to inform the reader 
              that this study reported on an earlier generation (1992) Screw-Vent 
              implant that, unlike the implants studied in the Journal article and 
              the PGD Article, did not have the friction fit innovation, which Dr. 
              Binon reported as having zero rotation. </p>
            <p>&#9;In addition to misleading comparisons, Dr. Binon actually misrepresents 
              the strength of Dentsply's internal hex implants by claiming on page 
              431 that "[i]nternal hexagonal joints, while having excellent non-rotational 
              capacity, are relatively weak joints." This statement is refuted by 
              the results reported in Table 2 (Torsion Failure) and Table 3 (Thirty-Degree 
              Compressive Load to Failure), which indicate that the Dentsply internal 
              hex implants were superior in both these tests to the internal octagon 
              (Calcitek) and external hex (Nobel Biocare) implants and, as described 
              above, the superior strengths reported by Binon in this article are 
              most probably either attributable to differences in diameters or in 
              questionable and uncontrolled test methods. </p>
            <p>&#9;Binon then gratuitously offers the readers his speculation, based 
              on a demonstrably false premise, as to why Dentsply's internal hex friction-fit 
              connection represents a "relatively weak joint":</p>
            <p>When the abutment is inserted in the implant body, it engages near 
              the corners of the hexagon. The middle part of the abutment flat does 
              not contact the side of the implant body. (emphasis added) </p>
            <p> As Dr. Binon must know from his evaluation of the Screw-Vent implant, 
              reported in detail in the PGD Article, the above statement is absolutely 
              false. The PGD Article included a series of SEM pictures of the Screw-Vent 
              implant abutment interface at 50X and 150X (Figures 8A through 8C). 
              On page eight of the PGD Article Binon describes the significance of 
              these photographs:</p>
            <p>The SEMs are representative of the five samples evaluated, and document, 
              at high magnification, the intimate contact between the full length 
              of the hexagonal flat and the 45-degree bevel. (emphasis added)</p>
            <p>&#9;Given these facts, there is no support for Binon's tortured explanation 
              as to why "the middle part of the abutment flat does not contact the 
              side of the implant body":</p>
            <p>In torsion, when the abutment rotates, the corners of the abutment 
              hexagonal strip against the wall and enter the larger-diameter area 
              of the original tap hole where there is minimal resistance to displacement. 
              (emphasis added) </p>
            <p>&#9;In fact, there is only one diameter to the tap hole, as evidenced 
              by Figures 6 and 8 of the PGD Article, and Binon is fully aware of this, 
              as demonstrated by his legend for Figure 6 in the PGD Article:</p>
            <p>This illustrates the characteristic intimate contact and frictional 
              fit between the internal straight hexagon of the implant and the external 
              1-degree tapered external hexagon of the abutment. (emphasis added)</p>
            <p>&#9;In a final attempt to support his false premise regarding the internal 
              hex design, while promoting the Spline implant, Binon purports to reference 
              the Balfour and O'Brien comparative study (reference #36 in the Binon 
              article):</p>
            <p>The implant body is also weakened by broaching to establish the corners 
              to engage the hexagonal. Sharp corners set up stress concentration points 
              during lateral and oblique loading that can result in wall fracture 
              during fatigue loading36.</p>
            <p>&#9;The Balfour and O'Brien study applied 82.5 pounds of force during 
              dynamic (cyclic) loading of up to five million cycles in order to achieve 
              the failure of the Screw Vent implant/abutment complex, while the Binon 
              study applied only 45 pounds of dynamic loading to the Spline -- hardly 
              a fair comparison upon which to base his conclusion that the Spline 
              implant is less likely to fracture. In fact, the Balfour and O'Brien 
              study, as reported by Binon in Table 3, shows that even the smaller 
              diameter (3.5mm neck) Screw-Vent implant, </p>
            <p>when compared to the 4.0mm Nobelpharma implant, demonstrated 35% greater 
              resistance to fatigue load under cyclic loading to failure, with failure 
              occurring in the body of the Nobelpharma implant, compared to the abutment 
              screw and neck deformation with the Screw-Vent implant.</p>
            <p>&#9;Binon's decision to test only the Spline 4.0mm diame-ter implant 
              led him to make unsound sweeping generalizations based on comparisons 
              of his actual data with results reported in other published articles 
              using different test methods. In light of this fundamental flaw and 
              the obvious contradictions between the claims made in his Journal article 
              and the results he reported in the PGD Article, Binon's current article 
              appears to have been written solely to provide documentation for marketing 
              rhetoric, rather than as a serious and sincere scientific study.</p>
