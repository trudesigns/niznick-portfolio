            <p>This is in reference to an article published in the JOMI (Rangert B, 
              Krogh P, Langer B, Van Roekel N: Bending overload and implant fracture: 
              A retrospective clinical analysis. Int J Oral Maxillofac Implants 1995;10(3):326-334). 
            </p>
            <p>In an analysis of fractured Br&aring;nemark Implants reported by three 
              clinicians, Bo Rangert, PhD, an engineer, minimizes the significant 
              numbers of the Grade 1, commercially pure titanium (CP Ti) fixtures 
              that broke, and fails to address the real solution to the problem: use 
              of stronger grades of titanium or titanium alloy in an implant design 
              and surgical protocol that preserves the marginal bone-implant relationship. 
            </p>
            <p>The study first claims to report on a &quot;total of 39 patients&quot; 
              treated by the co-authors, Drs. Paul Krogh, Burton Langer and Ned Van 
              Roekel (Clinicians), and Table #1 refers to 39 as the &quot;Number of 
              Restorations with Fractures.&quot; While the text states that &quot;the 
              fractures occurred in 22 mandibles (Fig. 1) and 17 Maxillae (Fig. 2),&quot; 
              the legend beside these bar-graph figures states that they represent 
              &quot;Distribution of Fractured Implants Among Different Treatment Categories.&quot; 
              By only reporting on the number of jaws or prostheses with fractures, 
              the true number of broken Br&aring;nemark Implants is being sidestepped. 
              As a case in point, Fig. 2 shows that only 4 implants fractured in maxillary 
              &quot;Full Arch&quot; restorations, whereas one of the Clinician co-authors 
              has subsequently acknowledged to me that all 5 implants fractured in 
              one patient with this type of restoration, which this text clearly fails 
              to reflect. </p>
            <p>To further minimize the significant number of fractured implants, the 
              article claims that the 39 fractures were recorded from an &quot;estimated 
              reference of over 10,000 implants placed,&quot; rather than from the 
              documented number of implants actually placed or restored by the Clinicians, 
              which was closer to half this number according to the Clinicians themselves 
              (personal communications). </p>
            <p>The article references &quot;unpublished data&quot; from a 3-year retrospective 
              follow-up by Bo Rangert and 3 American clinicians, which compared &quot;single-molar 
              restorations supported by one and two implants (21 and 25 patients, 
              respectively), with no fractures in either category.&quot; Such an absence 
              of reported fractures occurring with crowns supported by single mandibular 
              molar implants contrasts with a report by Mel Schwartz (USC Implant 
              Symposium, January 1995), wherein 50% of the Br&aring;nemark implants 
              in this clinical application fractured. </p>
            <p>The article concludes that &quot;the frequency of implant fractures 
              is low and, with appropriate treatment planning, overload situations 
              may be preventable.&quot; The observation time reported in this article 
              for the 39 patients with fractured implants was 7 to 79 months, with 
              32 months as the mean observation period. This short period of observation 
              must be viewed in context with the increased frequency of fractures 
              over time reported by Adell et al. (JOMI 1990;5(4):347-359) in the 20-year 
              Swedish experience with Br&aring;nemark Implants. The article cites 
              this study and acknowledges that </p>
            <p>it &quot;revealed a fracture rate of 16% in the maxilla and 4% in the 
              mandible after 15 years (7% and</p>
            <p>3% after 5 years, respectively),&quot; showing that metal fatigue with 
              titanium dental implants is a time dependent occurrence. </p>
            <p>The text also lists a number of increased load factors that contribute 
              to fractured implants, including &quot;in-line implants,&quot; angulation 
              of 15 degrees or greater, abutments taller than 7mm, bruxism and increased 
              leverage from crestal bone loss. According to the article, the majority 
              of the fractures occurred with bone loss to the 3rd thread of the Br&aring;nemark 
              Implant, which most often lines up with the end of the abutment screw 
              within the internally threaded shaft of the implant. The surgical protocol 
              for the Br&aring;nemark external hex implant requires countersinking 
              the crest of the ridge to accommodate the wider neck (4.1mm D) of the 
              3.75mm diameter implant, which lowers the bony support to the height 
              of the first thread of the implant. Studies (Br&aring;nemark et al., 
              Scand J Plast Reconstr Surg; 111 (Suppl 16):1-132; Cox &amp; Zarb, JOMI 
              1987;2(2):91-100) have shown that, within the first year in function, 
              1mm -1.5mm of additional bone will be lost, as measured from the base 
              of the implantâ€™s wider neck, which results in bone loss down to the 
              2nd thread on a routine basis. </p>
            <p>Choice of implant material as a consideration in improving implant 
              strength with a given diameter of implant is also discussed. The Br&aring;nemark 
              Implant is made of Grade 1 CP Ti (99.7% Ti), which has a tensile strength 
              of only 35 psi compared to 80 psi for Grade 4 CP titanium (98.4% Ti) 
              and 135 psi for medical grade titanium alloy (90% Ti-6% Aluminum-4% 
              Vanadium). The article attributes development of &quot;internal microcracks&quot; 
              in the implants to repeated loads and acknowledges that &quot;the fatigue 
              strength determines the capacity for withstanding such repeated loads.&quot; 
            </p>
            <p>An attempt to diminish the significance of this lack of tensile strength 
              in CP titanium is made by referencing a previous article by the lead 
              author, Bo Rangert (Nobelpharma News 1994;8(1):7), which claims that 
              the &quot;fatigue strength of Grade 1 CP Ti is practically independent 
              of its tensile strength.&quot; It repeats the claim made in the source 
              material that &quot;the tensile strength may be increased by work hardening,&quot; 
              but diverts from it with the admission that, while &quot;work hardening 
              may increase the tensile strength of Grade 1 CP Ti to the minimum of 
              the acceptable range for Grade 3 CP Ti,&quot; it has &quot;limited influence 
              on the long-term fatigue behavior.&quot; The authors are then left with 
              the only choices for reducing fractures with the Br&aring;nemark System, 
              both of which depend on available bone: using the wider (4.0mm D) Br&aring;nemark 
              Implants, which will increase tensile strength by 30% according to the 
              article, or just using more of the standard 3.75mmD implants. </p>
            <p>By selecting Grade 4 titanium over Grade 1, a 200% increase in tensile 
              strength can be achieved without having to increase the implant diameter, 
              which may not be possible due to limited available ridge width. By using 
              titanium alloy, almost a 350% increase in strength can be achieved, 
              even with only a 3.3mm diameter Screw-Vent Implant, compared to the 
              standard 3.7mm diameter Grade 1 CP Ti Br&aring;nemark Implant, which 
              safely expands the range of clinical applications to narrow ridges.

            <p align="CENTER">LETTER TO THE EDITOR</p>
            <p align="CENTER">International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Implants, 
              submitted on August 29, 1996</p>
            <p>TO THE EDITOR:</p>
            <p>My Letter to the Editor (JOMI 1996;11(4):431-432) commented on the 
              article by Dr. Bo Rangert, Dr. Paul H.J. Krogh, Dr. Burton Langer and 
              Dr. Ned Van Roekel concerning fractured Br&aring;nemark Implants (JOMI 
              1995;10:326-334). While it is not unusual for a journal to concurrently 
              publish an "Author's Response," as was done with Dr. Rangert's comments, 
              it is astounding that the JOMI further solicited a response from Dr. 
              Tomas Albrektsson and also published it under "Author's Response," since 
              Dr. Albrektsson was not one of the authors of the article. The inappropriateness 
              of Dr. Albrektsson's comments is even more evident when one considers 
              they pertain to a defense of his 1991 article on "Quantified Bone Tissue 
              Reactions to Various Metallic Materials," a reference which was deleted 
              from my original draft by the Editor, with my permission, before my 
              Letter was even published. Thus, Dr. Albrektsson's comments are totally 
              irrelevant in this context. Apparently JOMI and Dr. Albrektsson are 
              not only concerned about my written comments, but also about my unpublished 
              thoughts. </p>
            <p>Since Dr. Albrektsson was given an opportunity to assail, without challenge, 
              the bone response of titanium alloy, a material that is used by a number 
              of major implant manufacturers, and accuse me of reading his 1991 article 
              "in a poor manner," it is now incumbent on the Journal to publish the 
              deleted text of my Letter that addressed the use of implants made from 
              titanium alloy as means of reducing the incidence of implant fractures. 
              The deleted section is as follows: </p>
            <p>&#9;Osseointegration with titanium alloy can no longer be seriously 
              questioned. The only histological report critical of its use was generated 
              by Albrektsson, a Swedish consultant to Nobelpharma, and Jacobsson (The 
              Bone-Biomaterial Interface, pp 357-363, Toronto: University of Toronto 
              Press, 1991), who compared CP titanium and Titanium-6Al-4V and reported 
              a thicker proteoglycan layer with the alloy than with CP titanium. This 
              study used a sputtered coating of the metals rather than the bar stock, 
              a process that even Albrektsson (CRC Critical Reviews in Biocompatiblity 
              1994;114:189-192) had admitted in a previous article would create &quot;different 
              surface conditions compared to those of a titanium implant.&quot; Albrektssonâ€™s 
              attempt to discredit titanium alloy was addressed in a letter to the 
              editor that I wrote (J Prosthet Dent 1988;59(1):120-121), wherein I 
              cited a 10-year study comparing titanium and titanium alloy implants 
              in baboons (Andersson et al., J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1978;60:31) that 
              showed no difference in bone tissue response to the two materials. </p>
            <p>&#9;A subsequent objective Swedish study in the tibia of rabbits by 
              Linder (Acta Orthop Scand 1989;60(2):129-134) histomorphometrically 
              analyzed the bone response to 38 CP Ti implants and 10 Ti Alloy implants. 
              The author concluded that &quot;the bony reaction was remarkably consistent.&quot; 
              Albrektsson and Johansson (Davies JE, ed: The Bone Biomaterial Interface, 
              page 359) claimed that CP Ti implants averaged greater removal torque 
              (23.4 Ncm) than Ti-6Al-4V implants (15.5 Ncm). However, Carr et al. 
              (JOMI 1995;10(2):167-174) disproved that there was any difference in 
              removal torque between the CP and alloyed titanium, while proving that 
              the attachment strength of HA-coated implants is 250% greater than uncoated 
              titanium implants. </p>
            <p>The scientific debate over bone response to CP Ti and titanium alloy 
              becomes moot when one selects titanium alloy implants with surface coatings 
              in order to take advantage of both the strength of titanium alloy (i.e. 
              130 psi vs. 35 psi for CP Ti) and the increased bone attachment for 
              improved load-bearing capabilities provided by surface coatings of HA 
              (Carr et al., JOMI 1995;10:167-174) or TPS (Buser et al., J Biomed Mat 
              Res 1991;25:889-902). However, what is of concern is the ethical and 
              legal obligation of a dentist to inform his or her patient of the existance 
              of dental implant materials with less "propensity to fracture" than 
              Grade 1 CP titanium. This issue of informed consent is currently before 
              the New York State Supreme Court, County of New York, following multiple 
              fractures of Grade 1 CP Ti implants in one female patient (Case Index 
              No. 127071/95). </p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
