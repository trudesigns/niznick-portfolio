                </font></b><font face="Times,Times New Roman"> 
                <p>I take issue with many of the statements in the article, &quot;Bone-metal 
                  interface in osseointegration,&quot; by T. Albrektsson and M. Jacobsson 
                  (J Prosthet Dent 1987;57:597-607). </p>
                <p>The recurring theme of this article appears to be that medical grade 
                  titanium alloy (90% titanium 6% aluminum-4% vanadium) used in dental 
                  implants such as the Core-Vent is a potential health hazard and, as 
                  yet, unproven to achieve osseointegration. the authors’ carefully constructed 
                  premise quickly unravels when the article is closely examined, revealing 
                  an underlying bias.</p>
                <p>In the first paragraph, the authors state, by way of reference to a 
                  previous article of Albrektsson et al.,1 that &quot;of all the currently 
                  used dental implants, only two passed the defined success criteria: 
                  the Small transosteal implant and the Br&aring;nemark osseointegrated 
                  screw.&quot; That the Small staple implant is made from Ti-6Al-4V alloy 
                  is not found anywhere in the article, nor is reference to an article2 
                  in the Journal of the American Dental Association that confirmed that 
                  a staple implant, examined histologically (light and scanning electron 
                  microscopy) after 5 years of function, had achieved and maintained osseointegration. 
                </p>
                <p>The authors claim that they &quot;compared interfacial reaction to 
                  magnetron-sputtered CP titanium and titanium-6Al-4V&quot; (a high-temperature 
                  evaporation process used to create a thin specimen) and found the proteoglycan 
                  interface between implant and bone greater with the alloy. The significance 
                  of this finding must be viewed with skepticism, considering that in 
                  a previous article, Albrektsson3 had qualified the validity of this 
                  technique:</p>
                <p>&#9;&quot;It must be remembered that high temperature evaporation of 
                  titanium onto a surface may create different surface conditions compared 
                  to those of a titanium implant with a surface created by, for instance, 
                  machine cutting.&quot;</p>
                <p>There is no biological reason why the bone should not react the same 
                  way to Ti-6Al-4V as to CP titanium since they both have been shown at 
                  the angstrom level by using Auger analysis, to have the same TiO2 on 
                  the surface.4 Albrektsson3 confirmed the &quot;unique tissue acceptance 
                  of titanium oxide.&quot; Zarb5 stated that, &quot;Because the surface 
                  exposed to the biologic host system consists of a metal oxide, not a 
                  metal, it is the oxide that governs the chemistry at the implant-biotissue 
                  interface.&quot; Paar et al.6 concluded that &quot;Titanium, both as 
                  a pure metal and as an alloy, is easily passivated, forming a stable 
                  TiO2 surface oxide that makes the metal corrosion resistant...The clinical 
                  significance of the data is substantiated by more than 20 years of clinical 
                  experience with pure Ti and Ti-6Al-4V alloys.&quot; Andersson et al.7 
                  reported on 10-year results conducted on baboons, demonstrating microscopically 
                  a bone/implant interface with both the pure titanium and Ti-6Al-4V alloy.</p>
                <p>The authors also raise the issue of neurotoxicity relative to the aluminum 
                  leaching from the alloy. Considering that the FDA has approved the use 
                  of Ti-6Al-4V alloy and the orthopedic industry uses the alloy for most 
                  of its implants, the minuscule size of a dental implant compared with 
                  an orthopedic hip implant makes this point moot. </p>
                <p>The authors state that Core-Vent implants &quot;lack proper evidence 
                  of a bony integration.&quot; Apparently, the authors’ bias will not 
                  let them accept the extensive histologic and clinical evidence that 
                  Core-Vent implants have demonstrated osseointegration. Laskin8 reported 
                  on the results of five independent dentists having placed 609 Core-Vent 
                  implants with a 96.6% incidence of osseointegration. Lum and Beirne9 
                  placed Core-Vent implant in dogs and reported that &quot;the bone metal 
                  interface involved almost the entire surface of the embedded implant.&quot; 
                  An article evaluating the surface of a Core-Vent demonstrated an overall 
                  bone-implant interface at both the light and scanning electron microscopic 
                  level.10 A study by Chase11 of various types of implants, including 
                  the Br&aring;nemark and Core-Vent, confirmed histomorphometrically that 
                  the degree of mineralization, as tested at six points on the bone/metal 
                  interface, was equivalent. Lum and Beirne12 compared Core-Vent with 
                  Br&aring;nemark implants loaded in monkeys and reported that &quot;light 
                  microscopic examination revealed that both the Br&aring;nemark and the 
                  Core-Vent implants were in direct contact with bone.&quot; The surface 
                  contact area appeared to be the same.</p>
                <p>The authors have demonstrated in this article repeated attempts to 
                  link the osseointegrated Core Vent implant to fibrous encapsulated blade 
                  and subperiosteal implants and to ignore published animal and clinical 
                  research. It is unfortunate when those who have successfully climbed 
                  the ladder from basic science research to clinical reality attempt to 
                  pull the ladder up behind them.</p>
