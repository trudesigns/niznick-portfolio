                <p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
                <p>As we enter the 1990s, the Implant Industry promises to become an increasingly 
                  important part of your practice, offering both financial rewards for 
                  you and benefits for your patients. Once again, Core-Vent Corporation 
                  finds it necessary to set the record straight regarding issues that 
                  affect the field of Implantology. Your ability to make informed decisions 
                  is compromised by the dissemination of false and misleading information. 
                  The enclosed information will address the following issues:</p>
                <p>&#9;1.&#9;FDA Regulatory Compliance –– Core-Vent’s response to Nobelpharma’s 
                  &quot;negative marketing&quot; practices.</p>
                <p>&#9;2.&#9;FDA Premarket Approval –– Nobelpharma and the Swedish Trade 
                  Council vs Dental Implant Manufacturers Association –– Impact on future 
                  implant and abutment options and costs.</p>
                <p>&#9;3.&#9;Bias and Misleading Articles –– Impact on scientific progress 
                  and the FDA’s evaluation of the need for PMA studies.</p>

                <p>&#9;Possible Failure To File 510(K)S Charged To Firm</p>
                <p>&#9;FDA says Core-Vent, Encino, Calif., deviated from manufacturing 
                  specifications for its dental implant and apparently failed to submit 
                  510 (k)s for the second stage of the implants for the firm’s Screw-Vent, 
                  Swede-Vent and Micro-Vent, for bone-cutting instruments and drills and 
                  the electric motor/physio dispenser.</p>
                <p>&#9;The company also may be required to file a 510 (k) for the use 
                  of demineralized freeze dried bone for use during installation of endosseous 
                  implants, the agency said in a Regulatory letter. It said Core-Vent 
                  may be promoting the use of such bone graft material, though it was 
                  not mentioned when it previously submitted a 510 (k) for its endosseous 
                  implants.</p>
                <p>&#9;Good Manufacturing Practice violations alleged against the company 
                  included acid etching Swede-vent implants for 30 seconds when the written 
                  procedure limited the time to 10 seconds. The Regulatory Letter also 
                  charged that Core-Vent failed to submit Medical Device Reports after 
                  learning of malfunctions in at least four cases.</p>

                <p>&#9;Firm Believed Implant Heads Already Covered by 510 (K)</p>
                <p>&#9;Core-Vent, Encino, Calif., told by an FDA Regulatory Letter that 
                  510 (k)s may be required for the second stage –– or &quot;head&quot; 
                  –– of several dental implants, is responding that it believed it had 
                  received approval of that stage for all its implants when it filed a 
                  510 (k) for its newest product, the Bio-Vent. The same head fits all 
                  of its implants, the company said.</p>
                <p>&#9;But, if separate 510 (k)s for the head are necessary for the Screw-Vent, 
                  Swede-Vent and Micro-Vent implants, the firm will comply, Core-Vent’s 
                  president, Gerald Niznick, told D&amp;DL. He said the FDA just started 
                  viewing the head, screwed into the implant in a second stage process, 
                  as part of the device in 1987.</p>
                <p>&#9;Offering comments on an article on Regulatory Letter charges (D&amp;DL, 
                  11/17, page 4), Niznick also said Core-Vent did not submit Medical Device 
                  Reports on four malfunctions because they did not involve serious injury 
                  and the malfunction rate was below the expected level cited in the labeling.</p>
                <p>&#9;And, on an FDA allegation that, when the firm etched Swede-Vent 
                  implants for 30 seconds instead of the maximum 10 seconds called for 
                  in the specifications, it violated Good Manufacturing Practices. The 
                  firm said the procedures were written to allow 10 seconds to a minute 
                  for etching, the same as for its other implants. Niznick said that he 
                  will work with the FDA to resolve all issues raised.</p>

                <p align="CENTER">CORE-VENT’S RESPONSE TO NOBELPHARMA’S LETTER</p>
                <p align="CENTER">ON FDA ACTIVITIES</p>
                </b> 
                <p>In a calculated effort to promote its own products by casting aspersions 
                  on Core-Vent Corporation, its most successful competitor, Nobelpharma 
                  USA has been circulating copies of an FDA Regulatory Letter received 
                  by Core-Vent Corporation in November, 1989. The background to this incident 
                  is clearly explained in the attached excerpts from a medical device 
                  trade publication (Devices &amp; Diagnostics Letter, November 17 and 
                  24, 1990). Although Nobelpharma understandably chooses not to mention 
                  it, the substantive issues raised by FDA have all been addressed by 
                  Core-Vent Corporation. Furthermore, other than awaiting approval of 
                  the requested 510 (k) applications, we have been advised by the FDA 
                  that its files on this matter have been formally closed. The simple 
                  fact is that Core-Vent has never been subject of FDA regulatory enforcement 
                  action. Nobelpharma’s recent effort to &quot;smear&quot; the reputation 
                  of Core Vent products demands a factual response.</p>
                <p>Mr. William Ryan, President of Nobelpharma USA, stated in a letter 
                  dated January 17, 1990 to select educators and Nobelpharma System users 
                  in this country and abroad, that his company’s last FDA inspection resulted 
                  in &quot;no negative remarks.&quot; Mr. Ryan’s comments appear to be 
                  misleading because any FDA inspection of its US facilities would, of 
                  necessity, be limited to a review of paperwork associated its distribution 
                  and marketing activities in the US. In order for an FDA review of Nobelpharma’s 
                  manufacturing activities, the FDA would have to travel to Nobelpharma’s 
                  Swedish manufacturing plant. While Nobelpharma has been selling implants 
                  in the USA since 1983, it was not until May, 1989 that the FDA finally 
                  went to Sweden to inspect their manufacturing and packaging facilities. 
                  Nobelpharma Sweden was left a post-inspection FDA form 483 that contained 
                  ten negative inspection observations relating to sterile controls, labelling 
                  and response to complaints. To put this into perspective, it should 
                  be noted that Core-Vent’s most recent inspection in May 1989, the findings 
                  of which Nobelpharma has been spreading throughout the profession, resulted 
                  in a post inspection FDA Form 483 containing only nine negative inspection 
                  observations. One of Nobelpharma’s alleged violations of Good Manufacturing 
                  Practices related to 73 complaints in a seven-month period. Their May, 
                  1989 inspection stated:</p>
                <p>&#9;Complaints are not routinely documented with reason for not conducting 
                  investigations, e.g. 24 of 73 complaints since 10/88.</p>
                <p>The FDA supervisory comments of the Nobelpharma inspection report prepared 
                  after their May, 1989 inspection states:</p>
                <p>&#9;The firm may require written notice from IPTSB of the need to correct 
                  the discrepancies (sic) and product may have to be refused entry into 
                  the US.</p>
                <p>According to Regulatory Affairs, Vol. 2, Spring 1990, &quot;foreign 
                  firms are given advance notice of their upcoming inspection and the 
                  amount of inspection time actually spent in each plant is usually less 
                  than most domestic inspections.&quot; In spite of these advantages, 
                  Nobelpharma, during the 1989 plant inspections, still had more negative 
                  observations than did Core-Vent. While neither Core Vent’s or Nobelpharma’s 
                  1989 inspection reports is a performance that the respective companies 
                  should be proud of, and we assume that Nobelpharma has instituted appropriate 
                  corrective action in Sweden as we have in the USA, the fact remains 
                  that Nobelpharma is scarcely in a position to cast itself as the shining 
                  leader of the industry in matters of FDA regulatory compliance. Nobelpharma, 
                  when informed that Core-Vent was in possession of copies of their first 
                  and only FDA inspection (1989), wrote threatening that, if they &quot;learn 
                  that Core-Vent is distributing copies of FDA communications pertaining 
                  to any of Nobelpharma’s facilities,&quot; they would further distribute 
                  Core-Vent’s 1989 inspection report and even reports from previous years.</p>
                <p>ONCE AGAIN NOBELPHARMA UNDERESTIMATES CORE-VENT’S RESOLVE TO BRING 
                  THE FACTS TO THE PROFESSION AND NOT BE INTIMIDATED BY THEIR &quot;NEGATIVE 
                  MARKETING&quot; TACTICS. </p>
                <p>There are a number of other important areas where the ongoing performance 
                  of Nobelpharma, in our opinion, potentially raises significant regulatory 
                  compliance issues that the profession may not be aware of:</p>
                <p>&#9;</p>
                <p>&#9;1. 510 (k) PREMARKET NOTIFICATIONS: Nobelpharma has taken pains 
                  to point out in letters to the profession that Core-Vent was taken to 
                  task by the FDA for failing to file certain 510 (k) submissions for 
                  some of its abutments. We believe that our 1988 Bio-Vent 510 (k) filing 
                  had covered those abutments since the abutments are essentially the 
                  same for all of our implants. This was pointed out in our Bio-Vent application 
                  and our other implants were specifically cross referenced in that application 
                  by their 510 (k) numbers. Core-Vent, nonetheless, has submitted additional 
                  510 (k)s for those abutments. Nobelpharma, according to FDA records, 
                  has not filed a single 510 (k) since 1984. </p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;A. NO 510 (k) ON NOBELPHARMA’S NEW PROSTHETIC ABUTMENTS: In 
                  1988, Nobelpharma introduced a new Single Tooth Abutment and in 1989, 
                  a new Angled Abutment. Pages 16 &amp; 17 of their catalog indicate new 
                  components for new applications compared to the standard abutment that 
                  was in use in 1984 when Nobelpharma filed its 510 (k) marketing application. 
                  Although the new angled abutment utilizes a different method of connection 
                  to the implant than the standard Nobelpharma abutment, that could affect 
                  stability (a double hex with 12 points broached in their mating surface 
                  allows a 30 degree rotation instead of the traditional 6 sides of a 
                  hex), no additional 510 (k) premarket notifications have been submitted 
                  by Nobelpharma. A published article by Ohrnell, Br&aring;nemark et al., 
                  on single tooth applications with the Br&aring;nemark fixture (Quintessence 
                  International, Vol. 19, 1988) acknowledged &quot;loosening of the center 
                  screw, leading to a loose abutment and rotation of the crown&quot;. 
                  The article recommended a modification to the implant itself, extending 
                  the height of the hex to 1.2mm from the current 0.7mm to increase the 
                  interdigitation. In light of this, and the fact that the &quot;double 
                  hex&quot; base of the new Angled Abutment may provide even less interdigitation 
                  than the standard abutments, it would certainly appear that an FDA review 
                  of a 510 (k) submission prior to marketing would have been prudent.</p>
                <p>&#9;&#9;B. NO 510 (k) ON NOBELPHARMA’S NEW CONICAL SELF TAPPING IMPLANT: 
                  In 1988, Nobelpharma introduced a Conical Self-Tapping Fixture which, 
                  it is now apparent, represents a significant change from the original 
                  Br&aring;nemark fixture cleared in Nobelpharma’s 1984 510 (k) application. 
                  This is evident by the fact that Canadian customers (but curiously not 
                  American customers) were recently warned in writing by Nobelpharma that 
                  the Conical Self-Tapping Fixture (with its 4mm neck) should &quot;not 
                  be used for other than bone grafted cases or unacceptable bone loss 
                  may occur.&quot; This rather dramatic new restriction in the indications 
                  for this product was not present when the original Br&aring;nemark design 
                  was cleared by the FDA in 1984. This may well require the filing of 
                  a new 510 (k) notice due to the acknowledged differences in the safety 
                  and effectiveness of this new design. In Core-Vent’s opinion, the &quot;unacceptable 
                  bone loss&quot; reported with Nobelpharma’s new Conical Self-Tapping 
                  Fixture is the result of too long a neck, especially without the benefit 
                  of sufficient surface micro pitting created by acid-etching or HA coating. 
                  Nobelpharma might be advised to inform their American customers and 
                  the FDA of the potential problems with this implant when used in other 
                  than bone graft cases where bone loss is expected.</p>
                <p>&#9;2. THE &quot;CUSTOM DEVICE&quot; LOOPHOLE: The FDA exempts &quot;custom 
                  devices&quot; from such regulatory requirements as filing of 510 (k) 
                  premarket notifications, and defines such devices as one manufactured 
                  to meet the unique and special requirements of a physician or dentist, 
                  or those of his patients. Nobelpharma apparently has interpreted this 
                  regulatory loophole in such a way that its small diameter implants (3.0 
                  mm) are being sold to dentists through Nobelpharma’s &quot;Custom Design&quot; 
                  department, rather that securing a 510 (k) marketing clearance for the 
                  product. The 3.0 mm diameter Br&aring;nemark fixtures sell for $240 
                  each ($70 more than their standard fixtures) and are available pre-packaged 
                  in 7mm, 10mm and 13mm lengths with appropriate article numbers for re-ordering. 
                  Nobelpharma also sells new abutments for the 3.0 mm implants for $212, 
                  which is about $100 more than their standard abutments. This new implant 
                  design, therefore, may not be a &quot;custom device&quot; as that term 
                  is defined by the FDA, and would not be exempt from 510 (k) clearance 
                  prior to distribution. The 3.0 mm diameter implant and its smaller abutment 
                  may be particularly unsuited for continued distribution by Nobelpharma 
                  in this fashion, given the fact that a Nobelpharma newsletter to its 
                  customers noted that the 3.0 mm fixture is 50% weaker than the standard 
                  3.75 mm diameter fixture, raising significant questions about its safety 
                  and effectiveness in clinical use. The abutments for the smaller diameter 
                  implants may be weaker than Nobelpharma’s standard abutments, which 
                  are already 30% weaker than the Swede-Vent Abutments (Ohio State Study). 
                  An article by Amerian Sones on the complications with the Br&aring;nemark 
                  System (JPD, Nov. 1989, Vol. 62, No. 5, Page 582) reported that &quot;Of 
                  particular concern is abutment screw fracture, which can be a serious 
                  problem (Fig. 5)...if the fractured abutment screw is buried within 
                  the internal threads of the fixture, it may be un-retrievable.&quot; 
                  Given this article reporting breakages that render the implant useless, 
                  it would stand to reason that the new abutments for the smaller implants 
                  are potentially weaker and could result in even greater breakage. If 
                  Nobelpharma would consider using titanium alloy, as is used in the Micro-Vent 
                  and Bio-Vent Implants, instead of pure titanium, they could also provide 
                  a small diameter implant with adequate strength, as well as eliminate 
                  most, if not all, of the breakages reported with their standard diameter 
                  implant. As Dr. Franklin Young, Profession and Chairman, Dept. of Materials 
                  Science, Medical University of South Carolina, stated in his presentation 
                  at the NIH Consensus Development Conference on Dental Implants:</p>
                <p>&#9;Commercially pure titanium has barely adequate (perhaps inadequate) 
                  mechanical properties for dental implant applications, and while it 
                  is a logical starting material, unalloyed metals are not usually found 
                  to be optimum.</p>
                <p>&#9;3. MEDICAL DEVICE REPORTING (MDR): In Nobelpharma’s communications 
                  to the profession, it publicized that the FDA had questioned Core-Vent’s 
                  decision not to file an MDR for four of its implants, &#9;three of which 
                  had simply lost osseointegration. As members of the profession may be 
                  aware, MDR reports are generally required to be filed with the FDA whenever 
                  it comes to a company’s attention that one of its products may have 
                  been associated with a serious injury. Those members of the profession 
                  reading the Nobelpharma communications might erroneously assume that 
                  Nobelpharma, itself, is a paragon of regulatory virtue when it comes 
                  to MDR reporting. There is no record that Nobelpharma has ever filed 
                  a single MDR report with the FDA, despite the fact that a number of 
                  fractured implants have been reported to them, as well as a higher than 
                  usual number of failures of 7mm long implants in the maxilla. Furthermore, 
                  in an article published in the Journal of the California Dental Association 
                  (Mito, et al., J Calif Dent Assoc 1989;17:12-17,), the UCLA Implant 
                  Team reporting on its experience with the Br&aring;nemark fixtures documented 
                  that, while all of the maxillary &#9;implants followed for 24-36 months 
                  had initially achieved osseointegration, 25% of those eventually lost 
                  osseointegration. Without Nobelpharma properly warning the profession 
                  of the expected incidents of the loss of osseointegration, fracture 
                  of implants or fracture of abutments, it has been the FDA’s position 
                  that these types of failures be reported to the FDA through the MDR 
                  process.</p>
                <p>Higher Than Usual Failure Reported With Nobelpharma 7 mm Implant: One 
                  dentist claims to have reported to Nobelpharma 50% failure with the 
                  Br&aring;nemark 7 mm fixture in the maxilla and was told, according 
                  to his statement under oath, that this was not uncommon. MDRs serve 
                  the purpose of indicating failure trends so that the dentist can provide 
                  the proper informed consent to his &#9;patients, or stop using a product 
                  that is not predictable. One explanation for this higher failure rate 
                  is the wider neck, which requires countersinking, removing supporting 
                  cortical bone on the crest of the ridge. In addition, according to the 
                  published studies of Br&aring;nemark (1977 Textbook) and Zarb (JOMI, 
                  1987, Vol. 2, #2,), an additional 1.5 mm of bone loss, as measured from 
                  the base of the countersink, will occur in the first year of function. 
                  This is most likely due, according to Br&aring;nemark (1977 Textbook, 
                  Page 109), to &quot;high stress concentration in the marginal region&quot; 
                  from the wider neck being &quot;pressed into the bone site entrance&quot; 
                  during installation. In addition, the Br&aring;nemark fixture has no 
                  threads on the apical 1.0 mm of the implant so, after one year in function, 
                  only about 2.5 mm of the length of the threaded body provides anchorage 
                  into the bone. The 7mm length is also too short to allow an apical vent 
                  for bone ingrowth, providing anti-rotational resistance. Even if this 
                  implant osseointegrates with only 2mm to 3mm of length contacting the 
                  bone, the long-term predictability is questionable. Based on these facts, 
                  we invite Nobelpharma to ascertain the extent of the failures and make 
                  the FDA and profession aware of the results. If the failure rates reported 
                  by some individuals for the 7mm Br&aring;nemark Implant prove to be 
                  widespread, Nobelpharma would be advised to recall it or inform their 
                  customers of its limitations. </p>
                <p>The Swede-Vent 7 mm fixture matches the Br&aring;nemark 7 mm fixture 
                  in design, material and dimension. Core-vent Corporation is advising 
                  its customers not to use the 7 mm Swede-Vent fixture in the maxilla 
                  and, instead, is recommending a new 8 mm Conical Self-Tapping Swede 
                  Vent Fixture, which now has the type of short conical neck, apical threads 
                  and vent that has proven so successful with the Screw-vent Implant. 
                  The implant does not require countersinking in the maxilla because its 
                  gentle sloping neck can expand the bone. Using Swede Vent’s new flat-bottomed 
                  spade drill, the 8 mm Swede-Vent can be inserted in the same depth of 
                  osteotomy as was required for the placement of the 7 mm fixture when 
                  using a conventional drill with a pointed end, thus adding 14% more 
                  surface area for support.</p>
                <p>4. LABELLING ACCURACY: FDA labelling requirements mandate that product 
                  labelling not be false or misleading. In light of this clear and unambiguous 
                  requirement, it is interesting to note that Nobelpharma states in its 
                  product catalog that &quot;the titanium components and disposable instruments 
                  are guaranteed to &#9;be clean, sterile and free from contamination.&quot; 
                  A 1987 metallurgical report examining Nobelpharma implants, which was 
                  itself funded by Nobelpharma, paints a dramatically different picture. 
                  The Taussig report (#74305-1/August 27, 2987) documented particles of 
                  tin, lead, iron, and aluminum trapped in the &#9;folds of the machined 
                  titanium surface and stated, contrary to Nobelpharma’s labelling, that 
                  &quot;Br&aring;nemark implants exhibited evidence of nonmetallic particles 
                  on the surface of the implants while the implant had been sealed in 
                  glass containers.&quot; The report went on to note that &quot;Even though 
                  the implants have been rendered biologically sterile, the contamination 
                  of the metal surface by metallic particles had resulted in the implants 
                  not being sterile from a metallurgical point of view.&quot; The report 
                  also stated, &quot;It is our opinion &#9;that the metallic particles 
                  and nonmetallic particles that we observed on the Br&aring;nemark Implant 
                  surfaces, &#9;as well as the numerous areas where the apparently ground 
                  surfaces have been folded over, are not &#9;metallurgically satisfactory 
                  and can detract from the suitability of the implants for service.&quot; 
                  The metallurgist recommended that Nobelpharma take steps to see that 
                  the titanium surface be passivated (acid washed) &quot;to eat out any 
                  metallic particles and to help reinforce the passive oxide film on &#9;the 
                  surface of the titanium.&quot; Although Nobelpharma has yet to act on 
                  this suggestion, Core-Vent instituted &#9;acid-etching of its implants 
                  in 1986. Subsequently, we hired the same laboratory to evaluate our 
                  implants. &#9;The report summary stated that the Core-Vent implants 
                  &quot;in our opinion, appear to be metallurgically &#9;improved over 
                  that of the Br&aring;nemark Implants previously examined for Nobelpharma 
                  by our laboratory.&quot; </p>
                <p>CONCLUSION</p>
                <p>Despite Nobelpharma’s persistent and misleading effort to cast aspersions 
                  on our U.S.-made implant products through the distribution of a single 
                  FDA letter, while at the same time conveniently ignoring the problems 
                  associated with its own foreign-made implant products, as set forth 
                  in this response letter, we believe that American dentists cannot be 
                  so easily fooled &#9;. We challenge Nobelpharma to compete with us fairly 
                  in the marketplace, based on product versatility, quality, customer 
                  service, and price –– rather than on who can make the most accusations! 
                  We regret having to burden members of the dental profession with this 
                  response letter, but felt compelled to bring the truth to your attention 
                  in light of some of the misrepresentations which have been made. </p>

                <b>
                <p align="CENTER">RESPONSE TO NOBELPHARMA’S LETTER IN FDA PREMARKET APPROVAL</p>
                </b> 
                <p>On February 27th, 1990, Nobelpharma widely circulated a letter to the 
                  profession claiming to state where &quot;Nobelpharma stands as the dental 
                  implant industry faces increasing regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.&quot; 
                  This letter quotes a statement that Nobelpharma incorrectly claims is 
                  from a page of &quot;a petition by the Dental Implant Manufacturers’ 
                  Association (DIMA)&quot; to the FDA. While DIMA has filed a petition 
                  to reclassify endosseous implants to the same category as many orthopedic 
                  implants, the quote is actually from a letter DIMA wrote to the FDA 
                  objecting to a proposal by the Swedish Trade Council of the Swedish 
                  State Department. Nobelpharma and the Swedish Government are strongly 
                  advocating that the FDA proceed with the Premarket Approval process 
                  (PMA) that could cost the American dental implant manufacturers, and 
                  ultimately the American dental profession and public, tens of millions 
                  of dollars. One of the arguments made by the Swedish Trade Council in 
                  their petition is:</p>
                <p>&#9;To compare the endosseous dental implant with Class II devices 
                  such as artificial shoulder, knee, wrist, ankle and hip prostheses is 
                  irrelevant. The entire system of the endosseous dental implant, including 
                  the abutment, is a soft tissue penetrating device.</p>
                <p>This is a specious argument because treatment of complications with 
                  dental implants, which project into the oral cavity, is much less invasive 
                  than the treatment of orthopedic implant failures. The inside cover 
                  of the Br&aring;nemark, Zarb, Albrektsson Textbook, Tissue-Integrated 
                  Prostheses (Quint. Pub., 1985) clearly attributes no significance to 
                  the fact that dental implants are &quot;soft tissue penetrating devices&quot;:</p>
                <p>&#9;In the past, implant failures have been attributed to the epithelium’s 
                  apparent inability to predictably seal in the implant’s transepithelial 
                  contact area. This book suggests that the nature of the epithelium around 
                  the implant may be of academic interest only.</p>
                <p>The Premarket Approval process, called for by the FDA by 1992, will 
                  require all implant manufacturers to provide clinical studies according 
                  to a proposed set of guidelines. In Sweden, the government pays for 
                  treatment with Nobelpharma implants –– other implant systems are excluded. 
                  Therefore, Nobelpharma’s Swedish clinical studies have been financially 
                  subsidized by the Swedish Government. American implant manufacturers, 
                  on the other hand, will have to fund their own clinical studies to meet 
                  the PMA guidelines. For those companies still able to sell their implants 
                  after the 1992 filing deadline, there will be little incentive to develop 
                  new products as three-year studies would have to be conducted before 
                  they could be marketed. Nobelpharma is also advocating that abutment 
                  companies be regulated the same as implant manufacturers. Companies 
                  offering compatible abutments to the Nobelpharma implant, many of which 
                  are more cost effective, stronger or more versatile than Nobelpharma’s, 
                  may be faced with prohibitive research costs exceeding their gross annual 
                  sales. The FDA’s proposed guidelines appear to require separate studies 
                  of 100 patients for each location in the jaw and each prosthetic application 
                  for a total of up to 600 patients per implant design. The economic impact 
                  of this, especially for companies offering a variety of implant designs 
                  and materials, can be related to two government sponsored studies: one 
                  at Harvard where one blade implant was placed in each of 50 patients 
                  at a cost of $2,000,000, and a V.A. study of 150 patients, also with 
                  blade implants, which cost the taxpayers almost $6,000,000.</p>
                <p>A vast number of published articles have been submitted to the FDA 
                  demonstrating the clinical success and predictability of implants that 
                  achieve osseointegration. A number of articles also demonstrate potential 
                  complications and confirm that clinical success of any endosseous implant 
                  is highly dependent on the surgical skill of the dentist and his case 
                  selection, which cannot be controlled by the implant manufactures. Considering 
                  the high benefits and low risks of endosseous implants, as well as the 
                  usually detailed informed consent that most patients are required to 
                  sign, the entire PMA exercise, according to DIMA’s position, is not 
                  in the public’s interest. The anti competitive effect will result in 
                  higher costs to the profession and the public, as well as potentially 
                  compromise clinical success due to the reduced number of implant and 
                  prosthetic options. The need for different studies for each location 
                  and application only serves to make the costs prohibitive. Considering 
                  that the FDA guidelines do not even indicate a minimal success rate 
                  that must be demonstrated in any of the studies in order for the product 
                  to be sold, current FDA regulations appear adequate to assure safety.</p>
                <p>Nobelpharma sent the FDA a letter, dated February 2, 1990, along with 
                  several articles by Dr. Thomas Albrektsson, a paid consultant for Nobelpharma. 
                  These articles, according to Nobelpharma’s letter, support the Swedish 
                  Trade Council’s position that &quot;Implants can not be treated as a 
                  generic.&quot; It appears from Nobelpharma’s February 2, 1990 letter 
                  to the FDA that they know what is going to be in Albrektsson’s articles 
                  before they are even finished: </p>
                <p>&#9;Reference supporting our comment No. 5, Albrektsson/Sennerby, 1990 
                  is not attached to this letter. It will be submitted as soon as finished. 
                  Albrektsson/Sennerby reference is very essential in the generic discussion 
                  and the differences between implant systems in the clinical outcome 
                  of implant therapy.</p>
                <p>Several of Albrektsson’s articles, submitted by Nobelpharma to the 
                  FDA, conveniently omit or misrepresent studies of competitive implant 
                  systems, thus potentially giving a false picture to the FDA. For example, 
                  an article by Malmqvist and Sennerby, critical of the Core-Vent System 
                  (JOMI 1990, Vol. 5, No. 1) is referenced in the articles by Albrektsson 
                  and Lekholm and Albrektsson and Sennerby. Albrektsson, Sennerby and 
                  Lekholm are or have been employees of the Br&aring;nemark Clinic in 
                  Gothenburg, or are paid consultants of Nobelpharma. The Malmqvist and 
                  Sennerby article reports on only 43 Core-Vent implants (47 placed, 43 
                  followed). By applying a criteria of success related to measurement 
                  of crestal bone loss that was never used to determine success rates 
                  from any of the published Br&aring;nemark studies, the article reduced 
                  the Core-Vent success rate in the mandible from 88% (based on number 
                  of stable implants in function) to an artificially low 16%. The success 
                  criteria used in establishing success rates with Br&aring;nemark fixtures, 
                  according to Adell (JPD, 1983, Vol. 50, No. 2, Page 252) and Br&aring;nemark, 
                  Zarb, Albrektsson (1985 Textbook, Page 181), was &quot;fixture survival 
                  rate&quot; of implants that remain &quot;clinically stable,&quot; which 
                  they equate to being &quot;osseointegrated.&quot; To justify the Malmqvist 
                  and Sennerby anecdotal report, in light of the published results of 
                  the Patrick, Lubar, Buchs &amp; Zosky Core-Vent Study of 1,605 implants 
                  with 96.6% overall success rate (Journal of Oral Implantology, 1989, 
                  Vol. XV, No. 2), the authors attempt to negate its validity by falsely 
                  stating that the criteria of success was not clearly stated. To the 
                  contrary, the Patrick, et al., study stated that it used osseointegration 
                  as its success criteria –– just as did the published studies on the 
                  Br&aring;nemark fixture. The Malmqvist and Sennerby article reported 
                  seven failures out of 10 Core Vent Implants placed in the partially 
                  edentulous maxilla. To put this into prospective, the Patrick, et al., 
                  study documented seven failures out of 342 Core-Vent Implants placed 
                  in the same applications. The most logical conclusion that can be drawn 
                  from this comparison is that Dr. Malmqvist failed to follow the Core-Vent 
                  surgical protocol, selected too large a diameter Core-Vent for the available 
                  bone width, or overloaded the implants by poor prosthetic design including 
                  connection to mobile teeth. The Core-Vent Implant’s ability to maintain 
                  osseointegration in function was amply demonstrated in the Patrick et 
                  al., study with 100% of the 51 free-standing maxillary single tooth 
                  replacements with up to a five year follow-up. </p>
                <p>The FDA, faced with conflicting reports on implant success rates, will 
                  likely proceed with the call for PMAs. Core-Vent Corporation is supporting 
                  prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical studies using a research 
                  protocol developed at Harvard for our Core-Vent, Screw-Vent, Micro Vent 
                  and Bio-Vent Implants. Since the NIH Implant Consensus Statement (1988) 
                  attributed no more credibility to the Br&aring;nemark clinical studies 
                  than to studies presented on other systems, calling them all retrospective 
                  &quot;case series studies,&quot; Nobelpharma’s claim (Nobelpharma Newsletter 
                  1989, Vol. 3, No. 1), that theirs is &quot;the only system which already 
                  measures up to the FDA’s proposed requirements&quot; may be viewed in 
                  the same light as their previous misleading claims in brochures (1988) 
                  that they were &quot;the only system to use osseointegration,&quot; 
                  or that they had achieved &quot;99% long-term and complication-free 
                  success for bridges anchored in the lower jaw.&quot; Furthermore, Mr. 
                  Leif Ek, President of the Swedish Nobelpharma parent company, stated 
                  in Nobelpharma News (Vol. 3, No. 4, 1990) in reference to FDA’s proposed 
                  requirements that &quot;the Br&aring;nemark System may exceed them!&quot; 
                  The interviewer went on to ask Mr. Ek, &quot;Isn’t that why you want 
                  to see them brought into force, then?,&quot; to which Mr. Ek candidly 
                  answered, &quot;I won’t deny that we are businessmen.&quot; Nobelpharma 
                  would certainly benefit from FDA regulations that could result in substantial 
                  price increases of their competitor’s products or elimination of competitors 
                  altogether. Core-Vent believes that the current level of FDA regulations 
                  and market competition has served the public well.</p>
