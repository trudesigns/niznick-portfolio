                To date, many articles have been published stating the success and/or 
                failure rates of a particular endosseous implant system based upon an 
                individual clinician's experience. However, there are no reports of a 
                comparison between different systems and the clinician's success with 
                the different systems. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the 
                success rate of the two systems based on a single practitioner's experience. 
                In this manner, the same surgical technique, experience and postoperative 
                care were used on all patients reviewed, assuring minimal variations and 
                discrepancies that may be found when comparing one clinician's data to 
                another. Failures will be defined and identified according to jaw position, 
                timing of failure and treatment outcome. Complications associated with 
                the two systems will also be discussed.<br>

                the fourth year after placement (Tables 7 and 8). Furthermore, Moy<sup>7

                the implant in situ, the implant must be removed to prevent further deterioration 
                of the tissues. By postponing implant removal in such situations, implant 
                survival rates become falsely high for a few years, during which the patient's 
                surrounding bone complex may suffer irreparable injury. This criticism 
                is valid for stable as well as unstable implants. Two independent studies<sup>13 
                </sup> [Moy], <sup>14 </sup> [Malmqvist and Sennerby, 1990] of 100 and 47 consecutively 
                placed Core-Vent implants, respectively, have demonstrated an unacceptable 
                bone loss around these devices, leading to actual success rates of 50% 
                to 60% or lower when followed for less than 5 years. The Core-Vent implant 
                has been experimentally demonstrated to be osseointegraed14 with the simple 
                definition given above.14 [Malmqvist and Sennerby, 1990]<br>

                et al.<sup>55 </sup> did not report on stability tests or bone height measurements

                of which reported a dramatic bone loss around Core-Vent devicess (Figs 
                3a and 3b). Disregarding the already removed implants in the study by 
                Malmquist and Sennerby,<sup>57 </sup> there was a reported average bone loss over 
                27 months (the same average follow-up time as in the study by Patrick
