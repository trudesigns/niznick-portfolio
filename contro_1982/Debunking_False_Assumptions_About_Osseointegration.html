                </b> 
                <p>In his article in Oral Implantology, Vol. XII, No. 2, 1986, Dr. Charles 
                  Weiss argues the advantages of titanium blade-vent implants surrounded 
                  by fibrous connective tissue –– which he terms &quot;fibrous-osseous 
                  integration&quot; –– over titanium cylindrical screw implants that are 
                  in direct contact with vital bone commonly referred to as &quot;osseointegration.&quot;</p>
                <p>Weiss’s entire article, in fact, is replete with errors, inaccuracies, 
                  and misinformation. His liberal interpretation of references are based 
                  on false assumptions that lead ultimately to invalid conclusions –– 
                  all of which serves to support a glaringly evident bias toward the particular 
                  design, surface, and material incorporated into blade-vent implants 
                  sold by Oratronics. </p>
                <p>Whether a fibrous connective tissue interface offers the same support 
                  capabilities and long-term predictability as an osseointegrated interface 
                  seems to still be an issue for some Academy members –– as evidenced 
                  by the committee report from the Ixtapa, Mexico meeting, January 17-20, 
                  1985, on &quot;Criteria for Accepted Dental Implants and Modalities.&quot; 
                  It is not an issue with the vast majority of academicians and specialists 
                  now entering the field of implantology, as can be seen by the large 
                  number that are either using the Br&aring;nemark or Core-Vent osseointegrated 
                  Implants.</p>
                <p>Inaccuracies in Weiss’s article:</p>
                <p>&#9;1. Weiss states, &quot;Biocompatibility tests and basic biomechanical 
                  principles indicate that CP (commercially pure) Titanium is the biomaterial 
                  of choice for endosseous dental implants,&quot; and then gives no references 
                  to support his contention. Titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, in fact, has proven 
                  to be equally biocompatible1 as well as 60% stronger than pure titanium, 
                  thus allowing the design of an implant that, made of less material, 
                  leaves more bony support.</p>
                <p>&#9;2. The Br&aring;nemark implants, says Weiss, &quot;yield long-term 
                  results slightly less than 80%,&quot; referencing Br&aring;nemark’s 
                  textbook. Adell2 evaluated the statistics over the least ten years of 
                  the study (after the initial developmental period) and found that 81% 
                  of the maxillary implants and 91% of the mandibular implants achieved 
                  and maintained osseointegration for the five- to ten-year observation 
                  period. During the last five of these years, 95% of the maxillary implants 
                  and 99% of the mandibular implants successfully osseointegrated in the 
                  Swedish study. From 1973 to 1983, 100% of the lower fixed bridges supported 
                  by osseointegrated implants in the Br&aring;nemark study remained in 
                  continuous function, even though a few implants failed to achieve initial 
                  osseointegration or were subsequently removed.</p>
                <p>&#9;To the patient, continuous function is tantamount to continuous 
                  success. Most of the maxillary implants and all of the mandibular ones 
                  that maintained osseointegration for one year remained directly anchored 
                  to bone the entire period. It is noteworthy that, although the Swedish 
                  researchers experienced a learning and developmental curve, the real 
                  legacy of the Br&aring;nemark research was that, if one could get a 
                  titanium implant to osseointegrate, there was little chance the implant 
                  would ever be lost. This was confirmed in a recent article by Albrektsson, 
                  Zarb et al.3, which stated: </p>
                <p>&#9;The Br&aring;nemark results...clearly underscore the basic concept 
                  of osseointegration as being the major, if not the exclusive, reason 
                  for a successful long-term dental attachment...The results [in reference 
                  to a Br&aring;nemark personal communication] indicate that any implant 
                  losses after the first one to two years of function seem to be unlikely, 
                  provided osseointegration has occurred.</p>
                <p>&#9;Since the Br&aring;nemark research didn’t test implants of different 
                  material, design or insertion techniques in any controlled studies, 
                  the long-term predictability of an osseointegrated titanium oxide-bone 
                  interface is the basic principle he proved. This was the analysis of 
                  the Br&aring;nemark statistics that I noted in my articles, which Weiss 
                  pejoratively referred to.</p>
                <p>&#9;Weiss’s idea of valid statistical reporting is: &quot;Experience 
                  indicates that one out of ten fibro-osseous integrated blade abutments 
                  will falter when used, according to Harvard Conference Guidelines,&quot; 
                  followed by six references, none of which supports his contention. One 
                  article he refers to is &quot;Differential Diagnosis and Treatment Planning&quot; 
                  that he wrote in 1982. Although Weiss had been doing blade implants 
                  of over a decade by that time, there is no mention of his results, in 
                  either that article or in the present one, nor are there any statistics.</p>
                <p>&#9;Two others of his references in the current article refer to the 
                  Harvard Consensus document in which Dr. Linkow and Dr. Cranin, reporting 
                  their experiences with blade implants, exhibited a 30% difference in 
                  their success rates. Smithloff and Fritz4 reported the outcome of 33 
                  Linkow blade-vents. At five years, 14 implants were considered acceptable, 
                  eight showed adjacent radiolucent areas of approximately 4mm square 
                  and pocket depths of 4-5mm, while the remaining 11 implants (33%) demonstrated 
                  large radiolucent areas and pocket depths exceeding 6mm. Depending on 
                  the criteria used, the five-year success would be 42% - 66%. The ten-year 
                  results did not exceed a 50% success rate. This underscores the problem 
                  of establishing criteria for success if it is to be other than osseointegration 
                  as evidenced by absolute lack of clinical mobility. </p>
                <p>&#9;The achievement and maintenance of osseointegration in the Core-Vent 
                  Implant has been confirmed by an independent study now in its third 
                  year by the Drs. Lubar and Katin,5 who report an osseointegration success 
                  rate of 98 out of 100 consecutively placed implants. Lum and Beirne’s 
                  animal study,6 published in JOMS in May, 1986, shows Core-Vent implants 
                  in the research achieved osseointegration, with vital bone in the center 
                  and through the vents of the implants.</p>
                <p>&#9;3. Weiss’s claims of how many blade implants were &quot;supplied 
                  to the profession&quot; are preposterous. His estimate 1,250,000 implants 
                  sold between 1980-1985 at an average cost of $70, would indicate yearly 
                  sales of $17,500,000. Since Oratronics, the largest producer of blade 
                  implants in the last five years and a publicly-held company, realized 
                  approximately $1,000,000 in annual sales, Weiss’ inference that the 
                  millions of blade implants used are &quot;the broad base from which 
                  experienced clinicians draw conclusions&quot; is widely exaggerated.</p>
                <p>&#9;4. Weiss contends that the esthetics with the blade implants are 
                  better than cylindrical implants &quot;because the peripheral dimension 
                  of the peri-gingival cuff is so much greater,&quot; contraindicating 
                  &quot;ridge lap.&quot; In fact, ridge lap on the buccal and lingual 
                  of the small blade post (as shown in Weiss’ article) is contraindicated 
                  by an elementary understanding of basic fixed prosthetic principles 
                  of maintaining hygienic contours. If anything, it is the prosthetic 
                  principles of maintaining hygienic contours. If anything, it is the 
                  larger cylindrical head of the Core-Vent implant –– especially the plastic 
                  castable post, which can be added to with acrylic before casting –– 
                  that allows the greatest latitude for a simulated, natural tooth abutment. 
                  In further supporting the blade implant versus the Br&aring;nemark implant 
                  with the larger permucosal site, Weiss goes on to say, &quot;Clinical 
                  experience indicates that the gingival sulci of these larger perigingival 
                  sites seem to be more prone to periodontal breakdown no matter how well 
                  hygiene is performed. This is not true of fibro-osseous integrated abutments.&quot;</p>
                <p>This contention is unsubstantiated by the long-term results with the 
                  Br&aring;nemark implant, which showed only a tenth of a millimeter of 
                  crestal bone loss per year with minimal pocket depth, compared to the 
                  results of the study of Smithloff and Fritz.4</p>
                <p>&#9;5. Weiss’s chart comparing the &quot;typical case, elapsed time&quot; 
                  for treatment with osseointegrated implants versus blades plays fast 
                  and loose with the facts to favor blade implants. Both the Br&aring;nemark 
                  and Core-Vent System can be uncovered in three months in the lower jaw 
                  and four months in the upper; one can assume that the prosthesis can 
                  be constructed in less than one month. How many full mouth reconstructions 
                  can be completed in a busy dental practice in less time? Isn’t it better 
                  to take a three-month period to evaluate the results of intervention 
                  with implants prior to prosthetic reconstruction? Doesn’t the patient’s 
                  long-term welfare justify a conservative approach that allows the implants 
                  to heal unloaded, thus increasing the chance of achieving osseointegration 
                  at the interface –– with its long-term predictability –– rather than 
                  connective tissue?</p>
                <p>&#9;6. Weiss sees a problem of parallelism that would be present with 
                  the bendable neck of the blade implant. There is no problem with the 
                  Core-Vent or Screw-Vent Systems from Core-Vent Corporation, because 
                  both of these implants can accept the five bendable heads with a variety 
                  of abutment attachments. Even more opportunity for contour and parallelism 
                  can be obtained by a castable head. If the neck of a blade implant breaks, 
                  as can happen with any metal that is bent, the implant is rendered useless. 
                  With a Core-Vent insert, on the other hand, the fracture of a bendable 
                  neck can be corrected by recementing another insert.</p>
                <p>&#9;7. The claim that osseointegrated implants cannot be used &quot;in 
                  conjunction with natural abutments&quot; is false. Both the Core-Vent 
                  and Br&aring;nemark implants are in use connected to natural teeth, 
                  either rigidly or with stress-breaking precision attachments. Unlike 
                  the fibro-osseous blade implants, the osseointegrated implant can function 
                  free-standing as a single tooth replacement, or splinted to other osseointegrated 
                  implants in the partially edentulous mouth to support a fixed prosthesis, 
                  without relying on a natural tooth for added support.</p>
                <p>&#9;8. It is patently not true that osseointegrated implants must be 
                  used with acrylic teeth as the shock absorber, while the shock absorber 
                  with the fibrous encapsulated blade implants is physiologic, as Weiss 
                  claims in his chart. Osseointegrated Core-Vent Implants have been used 
                  for over four years with both porcelain and acrylic occlusal surfaces. 
                  In the totally edentulous jaw, the plastic is recommended because of 
                  its ease of use and resistance to fracture in detachable prostheses.</p>
                <p>&#9;9. More &quot;creative&quot; statistics in Weiss’s chart: &quot;90% 
                  of the jaws have adequate bone for the blade implant, but only 20% of 
                  the jaws have enough bone for cylindrical implants and then only in 
                  the anterior area.&quot;</p>
                <p>&#9;This is unsubstantiated speculation and has no place in a scientific 
                  publication. If Dr. Weiss did either Core-Vent or Br&aring;nemark implants, 
                  he would know this isn’t true. By flattening the crest of the ridge 
                  in the symphysis, and by angling to the palate in the maxilla, there 
                  are very few cases that cannot be done with the smallest (4.3mm OD, 
                  3.5mm ID) cylindrical Core-Vent Implants when adequate height of bone 
                  exists. The Br&aring;nemark and Screw-Vent implants are 1/2mm smaller 
                  (3.75mm OD). Osseointegration can be achieved with the new SUB-Vent 
                  (Submergible Universal Blade-Vent) Implant from Core-Vent Corporation 
                  when the slow-speed surgical protocol and unloaded healing period is 
                  followed.</p>
                <p>&#9;The question is not whether one must accept a fibrous encapsulation 
                  because of the amount of bone or the patient’s demands for an immediate 
                  solution to their long-standing problem. Since osseointegration can 
                  so consistently be achieved and since osseointegration offers such long-term 
                  predictability, can we professionally or financially afford to settle 
                  for less?</p>
