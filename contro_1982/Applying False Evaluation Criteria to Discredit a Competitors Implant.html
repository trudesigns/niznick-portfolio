                <p>TO THE EDITOR:</p>
                <p>Subject: Article by Jay Malmqvist and Lars Sennerby, Vol. 5, No. 1, 
                  1990: Clinical Report on the Success of 47 Consecutively Placed Core-Vent 
                  Implants Followed From 3 Months to 4 Years.</p>
                <p>This article applies two sets of proposed criteria of success, each 
                  containing a parameter related to measurement of crestal bone loss, 
                  in judging the success of 43 Core-Vent Implants (47 less 4 lost to follow-up). 
                  Since neither of these criteria were ever used to determine success 
                  in any of the published Br&aring;nemark implant clinical studies, the 
                  article misleads the reader regarding the success of Core-Vent implants.</p>
                <p>Schnitman-Shulman 1979 Criteria Applied to Core-Vent Implants: The 
                  Malmqvist Sennerby article applies the Schnitman-Shulman 1979 proposed 
                  criteria for implant success developed for nonosseointegrated implants. 
                  These criteria allow for &quot;mobility of less than 1 mm in any direction&quot; 
                  and also includes the parameter: &quot;crestal bone loss no greater 
                  than one-third (33%) of the vertical height of the implant.&quot; If 
                  the bone loss parameter were applied to the Br&aring;nemark implant, 
                  100% of the 10 mm and 7 mm implants would have to be considered a failure. 
                  To insert a Br&aring;nemark implant, 2mm of crestal bone is removed 
                  during countersinking, with an additional 1.5 mm of bone loss occurring 
                  in the first year following placing in function (Br&aring;nemark 1977, 
                  Adell 1983, Cox 1987). Therefore, as measured from the top of the implant, 
                  as was done with Core-Vent implants in this study, it would appear radiographically 
                  as 3.5 mm of the bone loss or 35% of the 10 mm implants and 50% of the 
                  7 mm implants.</p>
                <p>Albrektsson 1986 Criteria Applied to Core-Vent Implants. The Albrektsson, 
                  Zarb, et al. 1986, JOMI 1:11-25, proposed criteria includes a parameter 
                  relative to crestal bone loss: &quot;The vertical bone loss be less 
                  than 0.2 mm annually following the implant’s first year of service.&quot;</p>
                <p>Review of the Literature</p>
                <p>1.&#9;Adell: 17 Year Study on 4,000 Br&aring;nemark Implants (JPD, 
                  Vol 50, No. 2, 1983, page 252): &quot;The anchorage function or the 
                  fixture survival rate was defined as the number of stable, prosthesis 
                  supporting, osseointegrated fixtures in relation to the total number 
                  of fixtures installed.&quot;</p>
                <p>2.&#9;Br&aring;nemark, Zarb, Albrektsson (Eds.): Tissue-Integrated 
                  Prostheses (Text, Quintessence Publishing Co, Inc, 1985): &quot;Fixture 
                  anchorage function&quot; and &quot;fixture survival rate&quot; were 
                  the criteria of success. Page 175: &quot;The statistical basis for ascertaining 
                  the long term prognosis of a fixture-supported prosthesis depends on 
                  two factors: (1) continuous bridge stability...and (2) fixture anchorage 
                  function, which is the percentage of clinically stable and/or radiographically 
                  osseointegrated fixtures.&quot; Page 181: &quot;It can be concluded 
                  from Table 10-2 that approximately 95% and 85% fixture survival rates 
                  were achieved for lower and upper jaws, respectively.&quot;</p>
                <p>3.&#9;Engquist et al.: A Retrospective Multicenter Evaluation of Osseointegrated 
                  Implants Supporting Overdentures –– Eleven Swedish teams documented 
                  30% failure in maxilla, 6% in mandible (JOMI, Vol 3, No 2, 1988). Page 
                  132: &quot;An implant was regarded successful if the fixture had been 
                  immobile throughout the observation period and the radiographs showed 
                  no radiolucency around the fixture at the final registration.&quot; 
                  Page 132: Crestal bone loss was never measured in this study. &quot;It 
                  was not possible to register marginal bone loss with acceptable accuracy 
                  since the radiographic technique was not standardized.&quot;</p>
                <p>Malmqvist-Sennerby Study Lacks Scientific Objectivity. Malmqvist and 
                  Sennerby claimed to have measured crestal bone loss of 43 Core-Vent 
                  Implants in their study, but admit to not using standardized radiographic 
                  techniques: &quot;Panoramic and sometimes periapical radiographs were 
                  available from the day of surgery and 3 to 48 months postoperatively.&quot;</p>
                <p>The authors claim to determine implant success based on the amount 
                  of crestal bone lost without even taking into consideration the fact 
                  that if too large a diameter Core-Vent implant were selected for the 
                  width of the ridge, labial bone would be lost during the bone preparation 
                  procedure. This is quite obviously the cause of the bone loss in Figure 
                  1 of the article, where a 5.5 mm diameter Core-Vent (6.3 mm outside 
                  thread dimension) was placed in a narrow ridge. Labial bone loss at 
                  the time of surgical preparation will not show up in an immediate postoperative 
                  radiograph because of the radiopacity of the titanium, but by 3 months, 
                  the bone mesial and distal to the implant will have resorbed to blend 
                  with the labial scalloping, creating the picture of vertical bone loss. 
                  The article admits to having inadequate radiographs to measure bone 
                  loss during this period: &quot;The vertical bone loss occurring during 
                  the period from surgery to prostheses connection could not be measured.&quot;</p>
                <p>Albrektsson’s proposed criteria specifically requires that bone loss 
                  due to surgical trauma and bone loss due to remodeling under function 
                  not be included in the measurement. Only the amount of annual bone loss 
                  &quot;following the implant’s first year of service&quot; is to be measured. 
                  Malmqvist and Sennerby did not have adequate radiographs to evaluate 
                  how much of the change in height from the top of the implant to the 
                  level of crestal bone had occurred during the submerged period and in 
                  the one year following prosthesis attachment, so they arbitrarily allowed 
                  2 mm. Not only is this speculative, it does not even take into consideration 
                  the fact that the Core-Vent surgical protocol called for the implant 
                  to be placed 1 mm above the crest, as can be seen from the radiographs 
                  in Figures 1, 2 and 4 of the article.</p>
                <p>Malmqvist and Sennerby state that: &quot;The reasons for implant removal 
                  included rapidly progressing vertical bone loss, subsequent mobility 
                  of the implant.&quot; There is no documentation presented to indicate 
                  the implants lost bone and then became mobile. The more likely sequence 
                  would be that the implants failed to achieve osseointegration, which 
                  would be evidenced by mobility. If mobile implants are left in function, 
                  vertical bone loss will occur. The authors blame the design of the Core-Vent 
                  implant for the bone loss without considering that the most obvious 
                  cause was the surgeon’s selection of too wide an implant for the ridge. 
                  The authors do not consider that the failures were due to anything other 
                  than the &quot;inexact surgical technique&quot; which they claim to 
                  be &quot;unavoidable...when inserting the Core-Vent implant.&quot; Malmqvist 
                  actually experienced 74% success using the same survival criteria as 
                  the Br&aring;nemark studies. This anecdotal report of 42 implants represents 
                  the learning curve of one oral surgeon with his first attempt at osseointegrated 
                  implants, and must be put in perspective by comparing it with the 5-year 
                  report of 1,605 Core-Vent implants with overall success of 96% by Drs. 
                  Patrick, Lubar, Zosky and Buchs (Oral Implantology Vol XV, No 2, 1989). 
                  As part of the Patrick et al. study, 7 out of 342, or 2% of the Core-Vent 
                  implants in the partially edentulous maxilla failed using osseointegration 
                  as the criteria (98% success), it is inappropriate for the authors to 
                  blame the implant design or surgical protocol without even considering 
                  operator error in surgical protocol, or improper implant diameter selection 
                  for the available bone width. Prosthetic overloading is also an important 
                  factor in the maintenance of crestal bone height or even in osseointegration. 
                  It is important to note that all the reported bone height measurements 
                  with the Br&aring;nemark implant were in the anterior region of edentulous 
                  jaws while many of the Core-Vent implants in this study were in the 
                  posterior of partially edentulous jaws splinted to teeth. </p>
                <p>Based of the same set of criteria used to evaluate the Br&aring;nemark 
                  implant (i.e., osseointegration), the results reported by Malmqvist 
                  and Sennerby with Core-Vent implants placed in the lower jaw, as best 
                  as can be determined from the information contained in the article, 
                  is 88% success –– 33 implants with 4 being removed. By applying Albrektsson’s 
                  criteria, but ignoring its requirement that measurements be taken after 
                  the &quot;implant’s first year of service,&quot; the mandibular success 
                  rate was artificially reduced 15.6%. </p>
                <p>The Malmqvist-Sennerby article does acknowledge having reviewed the 
                  Patrick et al. abstract, but attempts to negate its significance by 
                  flatly stating: &quot;no success criteria or follow-up routines have 
                  been reported.&quot; The Patrick et al. abstract clearly states how 
                  the patients were followed up: &quot;During the study, 81 implants were 
                  lost to follow-up. The remaining implants and prostheses were recalled 
                  annually for clinical and radiographic examinations to check for osseointegration, 
                  gingival health and bone loss.&quot; The Patrick et al. abstract unmistakably 
                  states what criteria of success were followed: &quot;implants that had 
                  failed to achieve osseointegration (or lost osseointegration) were removed 
                  and the successful implants were placed in function.&quot;</p>
                <p>The authors support their findings by referencing a 1987 abstract by 
                  Moy, which has yet to be published in an article. Moy documented 84% 
                  to 87% success with Core-Vent implants, but then projected a future 
                  success rate of only 58% to 68% based on his own subjective criteria. 
                  The authors quoted the speculated rate rather than the actual rate for 
                  the three-year observation period, further misleading the reader. They 
                  failed to reference two other studies presented at the same 1987 meeting 
                  showing high success rates for Core-Vents (Lubar; Zosky and Kucey). 
                </p>
                <p>This analysis of the Malmqvist-Sennerby article clearly demonstrates 
                  that it is neither objective nor valid.</p>
